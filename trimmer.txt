THE

CHARACTER

OF A


TRIMMER


THE

PREFACE


It must be more than an ordinary provocation that can tempt
a Man to write in an Age over-run with Scribblers, as Egypt
was with Flies and Locusts; That worst Vermin of small
Authors hath give the World such a Surfeit, that instead of
desiring to Write, a Man would be more inclin'd to wish, for
his own ease, that he could not Read; but there are some things
which do so raise our passions, that our Reason can make no
Resistance; and when Madmen, in two Extreams, shall agree to
make common sense Treason, and joyn to fix an ill Character
upon the only Men in the Nation who deserve a good one; I am
no longer Master of my better Resolution to let the World alone,
and must break loose from my more reasonable thoughts, to
expose these false Coyners, who would make their Copper Wares
pass upon us for good Payment.

Amongst all the Engines of Dissention, there hath been none
more powerful in all Times, than the fixing Names upon one
another of Contumely and Reproach, and the reason is plain,
in respect of the People, who tho' generally they are uncapable
of making a Syllogism or forming an Argument, yet they can
pronounce a word; and that serveth their turn to throw it with
their dull malice at the Head of those they do not like; such
things ever begin in Jest, and end in Blood, and the same word
which at first maketh the Company merry, groweth in time to a
Military Signal to cut one anothers Throats.

These Mistakes are to be lamented, tho' not easily cured,
being suitable enough to the corrupted Nature of Mankind; but
'tis hard, that Men will not only invent ill Names, but they will
wrest and misinterpret good ones; so afraid some are even of
a reconciling sound, that they raise another noise to keep it from
being heard, lest it should set up and encourage a dangerous sort
of Men, who prefer Peace and Agreement, before Violence and
Confusion.

Were it not for this, why, after we have played the Fool with
throwing Whig and Tory at one another, as Boys do Snow-
Balls, do we grow angry at a new Name, which by its true
signification might do as much to put us into our Writs, as the
other hath done to put us out of them?

This innocent word Trimmer signifieth no more than this,
That if Men are together in a Boat, and one part of the Company
would weigh it down on one side, another would make it lean as
much to the contrary; it happeneth there is a third Opinion of
those, who conceive it would do as well, if the Boat went even,
without endangering the Passengers; now, 'tis hard to imagin by
what Figure in Language, or by what Rule in Sense this cometh
to be a fault, and it is much more a wonder it should be thought
a Heresy.

But so it happeneth, that the poor Trimmer hath now all the
Powder spent upon him alone, while the Whig is a forgotten, or
at least a neglected Enemy; there is no danger now to the State (if
some Men may be believed) but from the Beast called a Trimmer,
take heed of him, he is the Instrument that must destroy Church
and State, a strange kind of Monster, whose deformity is so
expos'd, that, were it a true Picture that is made of him, it
would be enough to fright Children, and make Women miscarry
at the sight of it.

But it may be worth the examining, whether he is such a Beast
as he is Painted.  I am not of that Opinion, and am so far
from thinking him an Infidel either in Church or State, that I
am neither afraid to expose the Articles of his Faith in Relation
to Government, nor to say that I prefer them before any other
Political Creed, that either our angry Divines, or our refined
States-men would impose on us.

I have therefore in the following Discourse endeavour'd to
explain the Trimmer's Principles and Opinions, and then leave
it to all discerning and impartial Judges, whether he can with
Justice be so Arraign'd, and whether those who deliberately per-
vert a good Name, do not very justly deserve the worst that
can be put upon themselves.



The 
Trimmer's Opinion 
of the
Laws
and
Government



Our Trimmer, as he hath a great Veneration for Laws in
general, so he hath a more particular for our own, he looketh
upon them as the Chains that tye up our unruly Passions, which
else, like wild Beasts let loose, would reduce the world into its
first State of Barbarism and Hostility; the good things we
injoy, we owe to them; and all the ill things we are freed from
is by their Protection.

God himself thought it not enough to be a Creator, without
being a Lawgiver, and his goodness had been defective towards
mankind in making them, if he had not prescribed Rules to
make them happy too.

All Laws flow from that of Nature, and where that is not the
Foundation, they may be legally impos'd, but they will be lamely
obeyed: By this Nature is not meant that which Fools and
Madmen misquote to Justify their Excesses; it is innocent and
uncorrupted Nature, that which disposeth Men to chuse Vertue
without its being prescribed,  and which is so far from inspiring
ill thoughts into us, that we take pains to suppress the good
ones it infuseth.

The Civilized World hath ever paid a willing subjection to
Laws, even Conquerors have done homage to them;  as the
Romans, who took Patterns of good Laws, even from those they
had subdued; and at the same time that they Triumph'd over
an enslav'd People, the very Laws of that place did not only
remain safe, but became Victorious; their new Masters, instead
of suppressing them, paid them more respect that they had
from those rho first made them: and by this wise method they
arrived to such an admirable Constitution of Laws, that to this
day they Reign by them; this Excellency of them Triumpheth
still, and the World payeth now an acknowledgment of their
obedience to that Mighty Empire, though so many Ages after
it is dissolved; and by a later instance, the Kings of France
who in practice use their Laws pretty familiarly, yet think their
Picture  is drawn with most advantage upon their Seals, when
they are placed in the Seat of Justice; and tho' the Hierogly-
phick is not there of so much use to the People as they would
wish, yet it sheweth that no Prince is so Great, as not to think
fit, for his own Credit at least, to give an outward, when he refuseth
a real worship to the Laws.

They are to mankind that which the Sun is to Plants, whilst
it cherisheth and preserveth them.  Where they have their force
and  are  not clouded or  supprest, every thing smileth and
flourisheth; but where they are darkened, and not suffered to
shine out, it maketh every thing to wither and decay.

They secure Men not only against one another, but against
themselves too; they are a Sanctuary to which the Crown hath
occasion to resort as often as the People. so that it is an interest
as well as a Duty to preserve them.

There would be no end of making a Panegyrick of Laws; let
it be enough to add, that without Laws the World would be-
come a Wilderness, and Men little less than Beasts; but with
all this, the best things may come to be the worst, if they are
not in good hands;  and if it be true that the wisest Men
generally make the Laws, it is as true, that the strongest do
often Interpret them: and as Rivers belong as  much to the
Channel where they run, as to the Spring from whence they
first rise, so the Laws depend as much upon the Pipes thro'
which the are to pass, as upon the Fountain from whence
they flow.

The Authority of a King who is Head of the Law as well as
the Dignity  of Publick Justice, is debased, when the clear stream
of the Law is puddled and disturbed by Bunglers, or convey'd
by unclean Instruments to the People.

Our  Trimmer would have them appear in their full lustre,
and would be grieved to see the day, when, instead of speaking
with Authority from the Seats of Justice, they should speak out
of a Grate, with a lamenting voice like Prisoners that desire to
be rescu'd.

He wisheth that the Bench may have a Natural as well as a
Legal Superiority to the Bar; he thinketh Men's abilities very
much misplac'd, then the Reason of him that pleadeth is visibly
too strong for those who Judge and give Sentence.
When those from the Bar seem to dictate to their Superiours
upon the Bench, their Furrs will look scurvily about them, and
the respect of the world will leave the bare Character of a
Judge, to follow the Essential knowledge of a Lawyer, who may
be greater in himself, than the other can be with all his Trappings.

An uncontested Superiority in any Calling, will have  the
better of any discountenance that Authority can put upon it,
and therefore if ever such an unnatural Method should be intro-
duc'd, it is then that Westminster Hall might be said to stand
upon its Head, and though Justice itself can never be so, yet
the Administration of it would be rendred Ridiculous.

A Judge hath such power lodg'd in him, that the King will
never be thought to have chosen well, where the voice of Man-
hind hath not before-hand recommended the Man to his Station;
when Men are made Judges of what they do not understand,
the World censureth such a Choice, not out of ill will to the
Men, but fear to themselves.

If the King had the sole power of chusing Physicians, Men
would tremble to see Bunglers preferred, yet the necessity of
taking Physick from a Doctor, is generally not so great as that
of receiving Justice from a Judge; and yet the Inferences will
be very severe in such cases, for either it will be thought that
such Men bought what they were not able to deserve, or which is
is as bad, that Obedience shall be look'd upon as a better
Qualification in a Judge, than Skill or Integrity, when such sacred
things as the Laws are not only touch'd, but guided by prophane
hands; Men will fear that out of the Tree of the Law, from
whence we expect Shade and Shelter, such Workmen will make
Cudgels to beat us with, or rather that they will turn the Canon
upon our Properties, that were intrusted with them for their
Defence.

To see the Laws Mangled, Disguised, Speak quite another
Language than their own, to see them thrown from the Dignity
of protecting Mankind, to the disgraceful Office of destroying
them; and notwithstanding their Innocence in themselves, to      '
be made the worst Instruments that the most refined Villany
can make use of, will raise Mens Anger above the power of
laying it down again, and tempt them to follow the Evil
Examples given them of Judging without Hearing, when so
provoked by their desire of Revenge.  Our Trimmer therefore,
as he thinketh the Laws are Jewels, so he believeth they are
nowhere better set, than in the constitution of our English
Government, if rightly understood, and carefully preserved.

It would be too great Partiality to say they are perfect or 
liable to no Objection; such things are not of this world; but 
if they have more Excellencies and fewer Faults than any other 
we know, it is enough to recommend them to our Esteem.

The Dispute, which is a greater Beauty, a Monarchy or a 
Common-wealth, hath lasted long between their contending 
Lovers, and they have behav'd themselves so like Lovers, (who 
in good Manners must be out of their Wits,) who used such 
Figures to exalt their own Idols on either side, and such angry 
Aggravations, to reproach one another in the Contest, that 
moderate men have in all times smil'd upon this eagerness, 
and thought it differ'd very little from a downright Frenzy: 
we in England, by a happy use of the Controversie, conclude 
them both in the wrong, and reject them from being our 
Pattern, not taking the words in the utmost extent, which is 
Monarchy, a thing that leaveth men no Liberty, and a Common- 
wealth, such a one as alloweth them no Quiet.

We think that a wise Mean, between these barbarous 
Extreams, is that which self-Preservation ought to dictate to 
our Wishes; and we may say we have attained to this Mean 
in a greater measure, than any Nation now in being, or perhaps 
any we have read of, tho never so much Celebrated for the 
Wisdom or Felicity of their Constitutions: We take from one 
the too great power of doing hurt, and yet leave enough to 
govern and protect us; we take from the other, the Confusion, 
the Parity, the Animosities, and the License, and yet reserve 
a due care of such a Liberty, as may consist with Mens 
Allegiance; but it being hard, if not impossible, to be exactly 
even, our Government hath much the stronger Biass towards 
Monarchy, which by the general Consent and Practise of 
Mankind, seemeth to have the Advantage in dispute against a 
Common-wealth; The Rules of a Common-wealth are too hard 
for the Bulk of Mankind to come up to; that Form of Govern- 
ment requireth such a spirit to carry it on, as doth not dwell in 
great Numbers, but is restrained to so very few, especially in 
this Age, that let the Methods appear never so reasonable in 
Paper, they must fail in Practice, which will ever be suited 
more to Mens Nature as it is, than as it should be.


Monarchy is lik'd by the People, for the Bells and the Tinsel, 
the outward Pomp and Gilding, and there must be milk for 
Babes, since the greatest part of Mankind are, and ever will be 
included in that List; and it is approved by wise and thinking 
Men, (all Circumstances and Objections impartially considered) 
that it hath so great an advantage above all other Forms, when 
the Administration of that Power falleth in good hands, that 
all other Governments look out of Countenance, when they are 
set in Competition with it. Lycurgus might have sav'd himself 
the trouble of making Laws, if either he had been Immortal, 
or that he could have secur'd to Posterity, a succeeding Race of 
Princes like himself; his own Example was a better Law, than 
he could with all his skill tell how to make; such a Prince is a 
Living Law, that dictateth to his Subjects, whose thoughts in 
that case never rise above their Obedience, the Confidence they 
have in the Vertue and Knowledge of the master, preventing 
the Scruples and Apprehensions to which Men are naturally 
inclin'd, in relation to those that govern them; such a 
Magistrate is the Life and Soul of Justice, whereas the Law 
is but a Body and a dead one too, without his Influence to give 
it warmth and vigour, and by the irresistible Power of his 
Vertue, he doth so reconcile Dominion and Allegiance, that all 
disputes between them are silenced and subdued, and indeed 
no Monarchy can be Perfect and Absolute without exception, 
but where the Prince is Superior by his Vertue, as well as by his 
Character and his Power; so that to screw out Precedents of 
unlimited Power, is a plain diminution to a Prince that Nature 
hath made Great, and who had better make himself a glorious 
Example to Posterity, than borrow an Authority from Dark 
Records, raised out of the Grave, which besides their Non-usage, 
have always in them matter of Controversie and Debate, and 
it may be affirmed, that the instances are very rare of Princes 
having the worst in the dispute with their People, if they were 
Eminent for Justice in time of Peace, or Conduct in time of 
War, such advantage the Crown giveth to those who adorn it 
by their own Personal Vertues. 

But since for the greater Honour of Good and wise Princes, 
and the better to set off their Character by the Comparison, 
Heaven hath decreed there must be a mixture, and that such 
as are perverse or insufficient, or perhaps both, are at least to 
have their equal turns in the Government of the World, and 
besides, that the Will of Man is so various, and so unbounded 
a thing, and so fatal too when joined with Power misapply'd; 
it is no wonder if those who are to be govern'd, are unwilling 
to have so dangerous as well as so uncertain a Standard of 
their Obedience. 

There must be therefore Rules and Laws: for want of which, 
or at least the Observation of them, it was as Capital for a 
Man to say that Nero did not play well upon the Lute, as to 
commit Treason, or Blaspheme the Gods. And even Vespasian 
himself had like to have lost his Life, for sleeping whilst he 
should have attended and admir'd that Emperours Impertinence 
upon the Stage. There is a wantonness in great Power that 
Men are generally too apt to be corrupted with, and for that 
Reason, a wise Prince, to prevent the temptation arising from 
common frailty, would choose to Govern by Rules for his own 
Sake, as well as for his Peoples, since it only secureth him from 
Errors, and doth not lessen the real Authority, that a good 
Magistrate would care to be possess'd of; for if the Will of a 
Prince is contrary either to Reason it self, or to the universal 
Opinion of his Subjects, the Law by a kind restraint rescueth 
him from a disease that would undo him; if his will on the 
other side is reasonable or well directed, that Will immediately 
becometh a Law, and he is arbitrary by an easie and natural 
Consequence, without taking pains, or overturning the World 
for it.

If Princes consider Laws as things impos'd on them, they 
have the appearance of Fetters of Iron, but to such as would 
make them their choice as well as their practice, they are 
Chains of Gold; and in that respect are Ornaments, as in 
others they are a defence to them; and by a Comparison, not 
improper for God's Vicegerents upon Earth, as our Maker 
never Commandeth our obedience to any thing, that as reason- 
able Creatures we ought not to make our own Election, so a 
good and wise Governour, tho' all Laws were abolish'd, would 
by the voluntary direction of his own Reason, do without 
restraint the very same things that they would have enjoyned. 

Our Trimmer thinketh that the King and Kingdom ought to 
be one Creature, not to be separated in their Political Capacity; 
and when either of them undertake to act a part, it is like the 
crawling of Worms after they are cut in pieces, which cannot be 
a lasting motion, the whole Creature not stirring at a time. 
If the Body have a dead Palsie, the Head cannot make it move; 
and God hath not yet delegated such a healing power to Princes, 
as that they can in a moment say to a Languishing People 
oppressed and in despair, Take up your Beds and walk. 

The Figure of a King, is so comprehensive and exalted a 
thing, that it is a kind of degrading him to lodge that power 
separately in his own Natural Person, which can never be safely 
or naturally great, but where the People are so united to him 
as to be Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone; for when he 
is reduc'd to the single definition of a man, he sinketh into 
so low a Character, that it is a temptation upon Mens 
Allegiance, and an impairing that veneration which is necessary 
to preserve their Duty to him; whereas a Prince who is so 
joined to his people that they seem to be his Limbs, rather than 
his Subjects, Cloathed with Mercy and Justice rightly apply'd
in their several places, his Throne supported by Love as well as 
by Power, and the warm wishes of his devoted Subjects, like 
never-failing Incense, still ascending towards him, looketh so 
like the best Image we can frame to our selves of God 
Almighty, that men would have much ado not to fall down and 
worship him, and would be much more tempted to the Sin of 
Idolatry, than to that of Disobedience. 

Our Trimmer is of Opinion, that there must be so much 
Dignity inseparably annexed to the Royal Function, as may be 
sufficient to secure it from insolence and contempt; and there 
must be Condescensions from the Throne, like kind showers 
from Heaven, that the Prince may look so much the more like 
God Almighty's Deputy upon Earth; for power without love 
hath a terrifying aspect, and the Worship which is paid to 
it is like that which the Indians give out of fear to Wild Beasts 
and Devils: he that feareth God only because there is an Hell, 
must wish there were no God; and he who feareth the King, 
only because he can punish, must wish there were no King; so 
that without a principle of Love, there can be no true Allegiance, 
and there must remain perpetual Seeds of Resistance against 
a power that is built upon such an unnatural Foundation, as 
that of fear and terrour. All force is a kind of foul-Play, and 
whosoever aimeth at it himself, doth by implication allow it to 
those he playeth with; so that there will be ever Matter 
prepared in the minds of People when they are provoked, and 
the Prince, to secure himself must live in the midst of his own 
Subjects, as if he were in a Conquer'd Country, raise Arms as 
if he were immediately to meet or resist an Invasion, and all 
this while sleep as unquietly from the fear of the Remedies, as 
he did before from that of the Disease; it being hard for him 
to forget, that more Princes have been destroyed by their Guards 
than by their People; and that even at the time when the Rule 
was Quod Principi placuit Lex esto, the Armies and Praetorian 
Bands which were the Instruments of that unruly Power, were 
frequently the means made use of to destroy them who had it. 
There will ever be this difference between God and his Vice- 
gerents, that God is still above the Instruments he useth, and 
out of the danger of receiving hurt from them; but Princes 
can never lodge Power in any hands, which may not at some 
time turn it back upon them; for tho' it is possible enough for 
a King to have power to satisfy his Ambition; yet no Kingdom 
hath Money enough to satisfie the avarice of under-Work- 
men, who learn from that Prince who will exact more than 
belongeth to him, to expect from him much more than they 
deserve, and growing angry upon the first disappointment, 
they are the Devils which grow terrible to the Conjurers 
themselves who brought them up, and can't send them down 
again. And besides that there can be no lasting Radical 
Security, but where the Governed are satisfied with the 
Governours, it must be a Dominion very unpleasant to a Prince 
of an elevated Mind, to impose an abject and sordid servility, 
instead of receiving the willing Sacrifice of Duty and Obedience. 
The bravest Princes in all times, who were uncapable of any 
other kind of fear, have fear'd to grieve their own People; such 
a fear is a glory, and in this sense 'tis an infamy not to be 
a Coward: So that the mistaken Heroes who are void of this 
generous kind of fear, need no other aggravation to compleat 
their ill Characters. 

When a Despotick Prince hath bruised all his Subjects with a 
slavish Obedience, all the force he can use cannot subdue his 
own fears; Enemies of his own Creation, to which he can never 
be reconciled, it being impossible to do injustice and not to fear 
Revenge: there is no cure for this fear, but the not deserving to 
be hurt, and therefore a Prince who doth not allow his thoughts 
to stray beyond the Rules of Justice, hath always the blessing 
of an inward quiet and assurance, as a natural effect of his 
good Meaning to his People, and tho he will not neglect due 
precautions to secure himself in all Events, yet he is uncapable 
of entertaining vain and remote suspicions of those, of whom he 
resolveth never to deserve ill. 

It is very hard for a Prince to fear Rebellion, who neither 
doth, nor intendeth to do any thing to provoke it; therefore too 
great a diligence in the Governours, to raise and improve 
dangers and fears from the People, is no very good Symptom, 
and naturally begetteth an inference that they have thoughts of 
putting their Subjects Allegiance to a Tryal; and therefore not 
without some Reason fear beforehand, that the Irregularities 
they intend, may raise Men to a Resistance. 

Our Trimmer thinketh it no advantage to a Government, to 
endeavour the suppressing all kind of Right which may remain 
in the Body of the People, or to employ small Authors in it, 
whose Officiousness or want of Money may encourage them to 
write, tho' it is not very easie to have Abilities equal to such a 
Subject; they forget that in their too high strained Arguments 
for the Rights of Princes, they very often plead against humane 
Nature, which will always give a Biass to those Reasons which 
seem of her side; it is the People that Readeth those Books, 
and it is the People that must judge of them; and therefore no 
Maxims should be laid down for the Right of Government, to 
which there can be any Reasonable Objection; for the World 
hath an Interest, and for that Reason is more than ordinary 
discerning to find out the weak sides of such Arguments as are 
intended to do them hurt; and it is a diminution to a Government, 
to Promote or Countenance such well affected mistakes which 
are turned upon it with disadvantage whenever they are 
detected and expose'd; and Naturally the too earnest Endeavours 
to take from Men the Right they have, tempt them, by the 
Example, to Claim that which they have not. 

In Power, as in most other things, the way for Princes to 
keep it, is not to grasp more than their Arms can well hold; 
the nice and unnecessary enquiring into these things, or the 
Licensing some Books, and suppressing some others without 
sufficient Reason to Justifie the doing either, is so far from 
being an Advantage to a Government, that it exposeth it to the 
Censure of being Partial, and to the suspicion of having some 
hidden designs to be carried on by these unusual methods. 

When all is said, there is a Natural Reason of State, an 
undefinable thing, grounded upon the Common Good of 
Mankind, which is immortal, and in all Changes and Revo- 
lutions, still preserveth its Original Right of saving a Nation, 
when the Letter of the Law perhaps would destroy it; and by 
whatsoever means it moveth, carrieth a Power with it, that 
admitteth of no opposition, being supported by Nature, which 
inspireth an immediate consent at some Critical times into 
every individual Member, to that which visibly tendeth to 
preservation of the whole; and this being so, a Wise Prince 
instead of Controverting the right of this Reason of State, will 
by all means endeavour it may be of his side, and then he will 
be secure. 

Our Trimmer cannot conceive that the Power of any Prince 
can be lasting, but where 'tis built upon the foundation of his 
own unborrowed vertue, he must not only be the first Mover 
and the Fountain, from whence the great Acts of State 
originally flow, but he must be thought so to his People that 
they may preserve their veneration for him; he must be jealous 
of his Power, and not impart so much of it to any about him, 
as that he may suffer an Eclipse by it. 

He cannot take too much care to keep himself up, for when 
a Prince is thought to be led by those, with whom he should 
onely advise, and that the Commands he giveth are transmitted 
through him, and are not of his own growth; the World will 
look upon him as a Bird adorned with Feathers that are not his 
own, or consider him rather as an Engine than a living 
Creature; besides, 'twould be a Contradiction for a Prince to 
fear a Common-wealth, and at the same time create one himself, 
by delegating such a Power to any Number of Men near him, 
as is inconsistent with the Figure of a Monarch: it is the worst 
kind of Co-ordination the Crown can submit to; for it is the 
exercise of Power that draweth the respect along with it, and 
when that is parted with, the bare Character of a King is not 
sufficient to keep it up; but tho' it is a diminution to a Prince, 
to parcel out so liberally his Power amongst his Favourites, it is 
worse to divide with any other Man, and to bring himself in 
Competition with a single Rival; a Partner in Government is 
so unnatural a thing, that it is a squint-ey'd Allegiance that 
must be paid to such a double bottom'd Monarchy. The two 
Czars of Muscovy are an Example that the more civiliz'd part 
of the World will not be prone to follow. Whatsoever Gloss 
may be put upon this method, by those to whom it may be of 
some use, the Prince will do well to remember, and reflect upon 
the Story of certain Men who had set up a Statue in Honour of 
the Sun, yet in a very little time they turned their backs to the 
Sun, and their Faces to the Statue.

These Mystical Unions are better plac'd in the other World, 
than they are in this, and we shall have much ado to find, that 
in a Monarchy Gods Vicegerency is delegated to more Heads 
than that which is anointed.

Princes may lend some of their Light to make another shine, 
but they must still preserve the superiority of being the brighter 
Planet, and when it happeneth that the Reversion is in Mens 
Eyes, there is more care necessary to keep up the Dignity of 
Possessions, that Men may not forget who is King, either out of 
their hopes or fears who shall be. If the Sun shou'd part with all 
his Light to any of the Stars, the Indians would not know where 
to find their God, after he had so deposed himself, and would 
make the Light (where-ever it went) the Object of their Worship. 

All Usurpation is alike upon Soveraignty, it is no matter from 
what hand it cometh, and Crowned Heads are to be the more 
Circumspect, in respect Mens thoughts are naturally apt to 
ramble beyond what is present; they love to work at a distance, 
and in their greedy Expectations which their minds may be 
fill'd with of a new Master, the old one may be left to look 
a little out of Countenance.

Our Trimmer owneth a Passion for liberty, yet so restrained, 
that it doth not in the least impair or taint his Allegiance; he 
thinketh it hard for a Soul that doth not love Liberty ever to 
raise it self to another World; he taketh it to be the foundation 
of all vertue, and the only seasoning that giveth a relish to life, 
and tho' the laziness of a slavish subjection, hath its Charms for 
the more gross and earthly part of Mankind, yet to men made 
of a better sort of Clay, all that the World can give without 
Liberty hath no taste; it is true, nothing is sold so cheap by 
unthinking men, but that doth no more lessen the real value of 
it, than a Country Fellows Ignorance doth that of a Diamond, 
in selling it for a Pot of Ale. Liberty is the Mistress of 
Mankind, she hath powerful Charms which do so dazzle us, that 
we find Beauties in her which perhaps are not there, as we do in 
other Mistresses; yet if she was not a Beauty, the World would 
not run mad for her; therefore since the reasonable desire of it 
ought not to be restrained, and that even the unreasonable 
desire of it cannot be entirely suppressed, those who would take 
it away from a People possessed of it, are likely to fail in the 
attempting, or be very unquiet in the keeping of it. 

Our Trimmer admireth our blessed Constitution, in which 
Dominion and Liberty are so well reconciled; it giveth to the 
Prince the glorious Power of commanding Freemen, and to 
the Subject, the satisfaction of seeing the Power so lodged, as 
that their Liberties are secure; it doth not allow the Crown 
such a Ruining Power, as that no grass can grow where e'er it 
treadeth, but a Cherishing and Protecting Power; such a one 
as hath a grim Aspect only to the offending Subjects, but is the 
joy and the Pride of all the good ones; their own interest being 
so bound up in it, as to engage them to defend and support it; 
and tho in some instances the King is restrained, yet nothing in 
the Government can move without him: our Laws make a 
distinction between Vassalage and Obedience; between a de- 
vouring Prerogative, and a licentious ungovernable Freedom: 
and as of all the Orders of Building, the Composite is the best, 
so ours by a happy mixture and a wise choice of what is best in 
others, is brought into a Form that is our Felicity who live 
under it, and the envy of our Neighbour that cannot imitate it. 

The Crown hath power sufficient to protect our Liberties. 
The People have so much Liberty as is necessary to make them 
useful to the Crown. 

Our Government is in a just proportion, no Tympany, no un- 
natural swelling either of Power or Liberty; and whereas in all 
overgrown Monarchies, Reason, Learning, and Enquiry are 
hang'd in Effigy for Mutineers; here they are encouraged and 
cherished as the surest Friends to a Government establish'd upon 
the Foundation of Law and Justice. When all is done, those 
who look for Perfection in this World, may look as the Jews 
have for their Messias, and therefore our Trimmer is not so un- 
reasonably Partial as to free our Government from all objections; 
no doubt there have been fatal Instances of its Sickness, and 
more than that, of its Mortality, for sometime, tho; by a 
Miracle, it hath been reviv'd again: but till we have another 
race of Mankind, in all Constitutions that are bounded there 
will ever be some matter of Strife and Contention, and rather 
than want pretensions, Mens Passions and Interests will raise 
them from the most inconsiderable Causes. 

Our Government is like our Climate, there are Winds which are 
sometimes loud and unquiet, and yet with all the Trouble they 
give us, we owe great part of our Health unto them, they clear 
the Air, which else would be like a standing Pool and in stead 
of Refreshment would be a Disease unto us. 

There may be fresh Gales of asserting Liberty, without turn- 
ing into such storms of Hurricane, as that the State should run 
any hazard of being Cast away by them; these struglings 
which are natural to all mixed Governments, while they are kept 
from growing into Convulsions, do by a mutual agitation from 
the several parts, rather support and strengthen, than weaken 
or maim the Constitution; and the whole frame, instead of 
being torn or disjointed, cometh to be the better and closer knit 
by being thus exercised; but what ever faults our Government 
may have, or a discerning Critick may find in it, when he 
looketh upon it alone, let any other be set against it, and then 
it sheweth its Comparative Beauty; let us look upon the most 
glittering outside of unbounded Authority, and upon a nearer 
enquiry, we shall find nothing but poor and miserable deformity 
within; let us imagine a Prince living in his Kingdom, as if in 
a great Gaily, his Subjects tugging at the Oar, laden with 
Chains, and reduced to real Rags, that they may gain him 
imaginary Lawrels; let us Represent him gazing among his 
Flatterers, and receiving their false Worship, like a Child never 
Contradicted, and therefore always Cozen'd: or like a Lady 
complemented only to be abused, condemned never to hear Truth, 
and Consequently never to do Justice, wallowing in the soft Bed 
of wanton and unbridled Greatness, not less odious to the 
Instruments themselves, than to the Objects of his Tyranny; 
blown up into an Ambitious Dropsy, never to be satisfied by the 
Conquest of other People, or by the Oppression of his own; 
by aiming to be more than a Man, he falleth lower than the 
meanest of 'em, a mistaken Creature, swelled with Panegyricks, 
and flattered out of his Senses, and not only an Incumbrance, 
but a Nuisance to Mankind, a hardened and unrelenting Soul, 
and like some Creatures that grow fat with Poisons, he groweth 
great by other Mens Miseries; an Ambitious Ape of the Divine 
Greatness, an unruly Gyant that would storm even Heaven it 
self, but that his scaling Ladders are not long enough; in short, 
a Wild and devouring Creature in rich Trappings, and with all 
his Pride, no more than a Whip in God Almighty's hand, to be 
thrown into the Fire when the World hath been sufficiently 
scourged with it: This Picture laid in right Colours would not 
incite Men to wish for such a Government, but rather to acknow- 
ledge the happiness of our own, under which we enjoy all the 
Privilege Reasonable Men can desire, and avoid all the Miseries 
many others are subject to; so that our Trimmer would keep 
it with all its faults, and doth as little forgive those who give the 
occasion of breaking it, as he doth those that take it.

Our Trimmer is a Friend to Parliaments, notwithstanding all 
their faults, and excesses, which of late have given such matter 
of Objection to them; he thinketh that tho' they may at some 
times be troublesome to Authority, yet they add the greatest 
strength to it under a wise Administration; he believeth no 
Government is perfect except a kind of Omnipotence reside in 
it, to exercise upon great Occasions: Now this cannot be 
obtained by force alone upon People, let it be never so great, there 
must be their consent too, or else a Nation moveth only by 
being driven, a sluggish and constrained Motion, void of that 
Life and Vigour which is necessary to produce great things, 
whereas the virtual Consent of the whole being included in their 
Representatives, and the King giving the sanction to the united 
sense of the People, every Act done by such an Authority, 
seemeth to be an effect of their choice as well as a part of their 
Duty; and they do, with an eagerness of which Men are un- 
capable whilst under a force, execute whatsoever is so enjoyned 
as their own Wills, better explained by Parliament, rather than 
from the terrour of incurring the Penalty of the Law for omit- 
ing it, and by means of this Political Omnipotence, what ever 
Sap or Juice there is in a Nation, may be to the last drop 
produced, whilst it riseth naturally from the Root; whereas all 
power exercis'd without consent, is like the giving Wounds and 
Gashes, and tapping a Tree at unseasonable Times, for the 
present occasion, which in a very little time must needs de- 
stroy it. 

Our Trimmer believeth, that by the advantage of our Situa- 
tion, there can hardly any such sudden Disease come upon us, 
but that the King may have time enough left to consult with 
his Physicians in Parliament; pretences indeed may be made, 
but a real necessity so pressing, that no delay is to be admitted, 
is hardly to be imagin'd, and it will be neither easie to give an 
instance of any such thing for the time past, or reasonable to 
Presume it will ever happen for the time to come: but if that 
strange thing should fall out, our Trimmer is not so streight- 
lac'd, as to let a Nation die, or to be stifled, rather than it 
should be help'd by any but the proper Officers. The Cases 
themselves will bring the Remedies along with them; and he 
is not afraid to allow that in order to its preservation, there is 
a hidden Power in Government, which would be lost if it was 
defined, a certain Mystery, by virtue of which a Nation may at 
some Critical times be secur'd from Ruine; but then it must be 
kept as a Mystery; it is rendred useless when touch 'd by un- 
skilfull hands, and no Government ever had, or deserv'd to 
have that Power, which was so unwary as to anticipate their 
claim to it: Our Trimmer cannot help thinking it had been 
better, if the Triennial Act had been observed; because 'tis the 
Law, and he would not have the Crown, by such an Example, 
teach the Nation to break it; all irregularity is catching, it 
hath a Contagion in it, especially in an Age so much more 
enclin'd to follow ill Patterns than good ones. 

He would have had a Parliament, because 'tis an Essential part 
of the Constitution, even without the Law, it being the only 
Provision in extraordinary Cases, in which there would be other- 
wise no Remedy, and there can be no greater Solecism in 
Government, than a failure of Justice. 

He would have had one, because nothing else can unite and 
heal us, all other Means are meer Shifts and Projects, Houses 
of Cards, to be blown down with the least Breath, and cannot 
resist the Difficulties which are ever presum'd in things of this 
kind; and he would have had one, because it might have 
done the King good, and could not possibly have done him hurt, 
without his consent, which in that Case is not to be supposed, 
and therefore for him to fear it, is so strange and so little to be 
comprehended, that the Reasons can never be presum'd to grow 
in our Soyl, or to thrive in it when Transplanted from any 
other Country; and no doubt there are such irresistible Argu- 
ments for calling a Parliament, that tho it might be deny'd to 
the unmannerly mutinous Petitions of men, that are malicious 
and disaffected, it will be granted to the soft and obsequious 
Murmurs of his Majesty's best Subjects, and there will be such 
Rhetorick in their silent Grief, that it will at last prevail against 
the Artifices of those, who either out of Guilt or Interest, are 
afraid to throw themselves upon their Country, knowing how 
scurvily they have used it; that day of Judgment will come, 
tho we know neither the day nor the hour. And our Trimmer 
would live so as to be prepared for it, with full assurance in the 
mean time, that the lamenting Voice of a Nation cannot long 
be resisted, and that a Prince who could so easily forgive his 
People when they had been in the wrong, cannot fail to hear 
them when they are in the right. 
Religion hath such a Superiority above other things, and that 
indispensable Influence upon all Mankind, that it is as neces- 
sary to our Living Happy in this World, as it is to our being 
Sav'd in the next, without it man is an abandon 'd Creature, one 
of the worst Beasts Nature hath produc'd, and fit only for the 
Society of Wolves and Bears; therefore in all Ages it hath been 
the Foundation of Government: and tho' false Gods have been 
impos'd upon the Credulous part of the World, yet they were 
Gods still in their Opinion, and the Awe and Reverence Men 
had to them and their Oracles, kept them within bounds to- 
wards one another, which the Laws with all their Authority 
could never have effected without the help of Religion; the 
Laws would not be able to subdue the perverseness of Mens 
Wills, which are Wild Beasts, and require a double Chain 
to keep them down; for this Reason 'tis said, That it is 
not a sufficient ground to make War upon a Neighbouring 
State, because they are of another Religion, let it be never so 
differing; yet if they Worship nor Acknowledge no Deity at all, 
they may be Invaded as Publick Enemies of Mankind, because 
they reject the only thing that can bind them to live well with 
one another; the consideration of Religion is so twisted with 
that of Government, that it is never to be separated, and tho the 
Foundations of it ought to be Eternal and Unchangeable, yet 
the Terms and Circumstances of Discipline, are to be suited to 
the several Climates and Constitutions, so that they may keep 
men in a willing Acquiescence unto them, without discomposing 
the World by nice disputes, which can never be of equal moment 
with the publick Peace. 

Our Religion here in England seemeth to be distinguished by 
a peculiar effect of God Almighty's goodness, in permiting it 
to be introduced, or rather restored, by a more regular Method 
than the Circumstances of most other Reformed Churches would 
allow them to do, in relation to the Government; and the 
Dignity with which it hath supported it self since, and the great 
Men our Church hath produced, ought to recommend it to the 
esteem of all Protestants at least: Our Trimmer is very partial 
to it, for these Reasons, and many more, and desireth that it 
may preserve its due Jurisdiction and Authority; so far he is 
from wishing it oppressed by the unreasonable and malicious 
Cavils of those who take pains to raise Objections against it. 

The Questions will then be, how and by what Methods this 
Church shall best support it self (the present Circumstances 
consider'd) in relation to Dissenters of all sorts: I will first lay 
this for a ground, That as there can be no true Religion with- 
out Charity, so there can be no true humane prudence without 
bearing and condescension: This Principle doth not extend to 
oblige the Church always to yield to those who are disposed to 
Contest with her, the expediency of doing it is to be considered 
and determined according to the occasion, and this leads me to 
lay open the thoughts of our Trimmer, in reference first, to the 
Protestants, and then to the Popish Recusants. 

What hath lately hapned among us, maketh an Apology 
necessary for saying any thing that looketh like favour to- 
wards a sort of Men who have brought themselves under such 
a disadvantage. 

The late Conspiracy hath such broad Symptoms of the dis- 
affection of the whole Party, that upon the first reflections, 
while our thoughts are warm, it would almost perswade us to 
put them out of the protection of our good Nature, and to 
think that the Christian Indulgence which our compassion for 
other Mens Sufferings cannot easily deny, seemeth not only to 
be forfeited by the ill appearances that are against them, but 
even becometh a Crime when it is so misapplied; yet for all 
this, upon second and cooler thoughts, moderate Men will not 
be so ready to involve a whole Party in the guilt of a few, and 
to admit inferences and Presumptions to be Evidence in a Case, 
where the Sentence must be so heavy, as it ought to be against 
all those who have a fixed resolution against the Government 
established: besides, Men who act by a Principle grounded 
upon Moral Vertue, can never let it be clearly extinguished, by 
the most repeated Provocations; if a right thing agreeable to 
Nature and good Sense taketh root in the heart of a Man that 
is impartial and unbyass'd, no outward Circumstances can ever 
destroy it; it is true, the degrees of a Mans Zeal for the Prosecu- 
tion of it may be differing; the faults of other Men, the con- 
sideration of the publick, and the seasonable Prudence by which 
Wise Men will ever be directed, may give great Allays; they 
may lessen and for a time perhaps suppress the exercise of that, 
which in general Proposition may be reasonable, but still what- 
ever is so will inevitably grow and spring up again, having 
a Foundation in Nature, which is never to be destroyed. 

Our Trimmer therefore endeavoureth to separate the detesta- 
tion of those who had either a hand or a thought in the late 
Plot, from the Principle of Prudential as well as Christian 
Charity towards Mankind, and for that reason would fain use 
the means of reclaiming such of the Dissenters as are not in- 
curable, and even of bearing to a degree those that are, as far as 
may consist with the Publick Interest and Security; he is far 
from justifying an affected separation from the Communion of 
the Church, and even in those that mean well and are mistaken, 
he looketh upon it as a Disease that hath seized upon their 
Minds, very troublesome as well as dangerous, by the Conse- 
quence it may produce: he doth not go about to excuse their 
making it an indispensable duty, to meet in numbers to say 
their Prayers; such meetings may prove mischievous to the 
State; at least the Laws, which are the best Judges, have 
determined that there is danger in them: he hath good nature 
enough to lament that the perversness of a Part should have 
drawn Rigorous Laws upon the whole Body of the Dissenters, 
but when they are once made no private Opinion must stand in 
Opposition to them; if they are in themselves reasonable, they 
are in that respect to be regarded, even without being enjoyned; 
if by the Change of Time and Circumstances they should be- 
come less reasonable than when they were first made, even then 
they are to be obey'd too, because they are Laws, till they are 
mended or repealed by the same Authority that Enacted them. 

He hath too much deference to the Constitution of our 
Government, to wish for more Prerogative Declarations in 
favour of scrupulous Men, or to dispence with Penal Laws in 
such manner, or to such an end, that suspecting Men might 
with some reason pretend, that so hated a thing as Persecution 
could never make way for it self with any hopes of Success, 
otherwise than by preparing the deluded World by a false 
prospect of Liberty and Indulgence. The inward Springs and 
Wheels whereby the Engine moved, are now so fully laid open 
and expos'd that it is not supposable that such a baffled Ex- 
periment should ever be tryed again; the effect it had at the 
time, and the Spirit it raised, will not easily be forgotten, and 
it may be presumed the remembrance of it may secure us from 
any more attempts of that Nature for the future; we must no 
more break a Law to give Men ease, than we are to Rifle an 
House with a devout intention of giving the plunder to the 
Poor; in this case, our Compassion would be as ill directed, as 
our Charity in the other. 

In short, the veneration due to the Laws is never to be thrown 
off, let the pretences be never so specious; yet with all this he 
cannot bring himself to think, that an extraordinary diligence to 
take the uttermost penalty of Laws, upon the poor offending 
Neighbour, is of it self such an all sufficient vertue, that without 
any thing else to recommend Men, it should Entitle them to 
all kind of Preferments and Rewards; he would not detract 
from the merits of those who execute the Laws, yet he cannot 
think such a piece of service as this, can entirely change the 
Man, and either make him a better Divine, or a more knowing 
Magistrate than he was before, especially if it be done with a 
partial and unequal hand in Reverence to greater and more 
dangerous Offenders. 

Our Trimmer would have those mistaken Men ready to throw 
themselves into the arms of the Church, and he would have 
those arms as ready to receive them that shall come to us; he 
would have no supercilious look to fright those strayed Sheep 
from coming into the Fold again; no ill-natur'd maxims of an 
Eternal suspicion, or a belief that those who have once been in 
the wrong can never be in the right again; but a visible prepara- 
tion of mind to receive with joy all the Proselytes that come 
amongst us, and much greater earnestness to reclaim than 
punish them: It is to be confessed, there is a great deal to 
forgive, a hard task enough for the Charity of a Church so pro- 
voked; but that must not cut off all hopes of being reconciled, 
yet if there must be some anger left still, let it break out into 
a Christian Revenge, and by being kinder to the Children of 
Disobedience than they deserve, let the injured Church Triumph, 
by throwing shame and confusion of face upon them; there 
should not always be Storms and Thunder, a clear Sky would 
sometime make the Church look more like Heaven, and would 
do more towards the reclaiming those wanderers, than a per- 
petual terrour, which seemeth to have no intermission; for there 
is in many, and particularly in English Men, a mistaken 
pleasure, in resisting the dictates of Rigorous Authority; a 
Stomach that riseth against a hard imposition, nay, in some, 
even a lust in suffering from a wrong point of Honour, 
which doth not want the applause, from the greater part of 
Mankind, who have not learnt to distinguish; constancy will 
be thought a virtue even where it is a mistake; and the ill 
Judging World will be apt to think that Opinion most right, 
which produceth the greatest number of those who are willing 
to suffer for it; all this is prevented, and falleth to the ground, 
by using well-timed Indulgence; and the stubborn Adversary 
who valueth himself upon his Resistance whilst he is oppress'd, 
yieldeth insensibly to kind Methods, when they are apply'd to 
him, and the same Man naturally melteth into Conformity, who 
perhaps would never have been beaten into it. We may be 
taught by the Compassion that attendeth the most Criminal 
Men when they are Condemned, that Faults are much more 
natural things than Punishments, and that even the most 
necessary acts of severity do some kind of violence to our 
Nature, whose Indulgence will not be confined within the 
strait bounds of inexorable Justice; so that this should be an 
Argument for gentleness, besides that it is the likeliest way to 
make these Men ashamed of their Separation, whilst the pressing 
them too hard, tendeth rather to make them proud of it. 
Our Trimmer would have the Clergy supported in their 
Lawful Rights, and in all the Power and Dignity that belongeth 
to them, and yet he thinketh that possibly there may be in 
some of them a too great eagerness to extend the Ecclesiastical 
Jurisdiction; which tho it may be well intended, yet the strain- 
ing of it too high hath an appearance of Ambition that raiseth 
mens Objections to it, and is so far unlike the Apostolick 
Zeal, which was quite otherwise employ'd, that the World 
draweth inferences from it, which do the Church no service. 

He is troubled to see Men of all sides sick of a Calenture 
of a mistaken Devotion, and it seemeth to him that the devout 
Fire of mistaken Charity with which the Primitive Christians 
were inflam'd, is long since extinguished, and instead of it a 
devouring Fire of Anger and Persecution breaketh out in the 
World; we wrangle now one with another about Religion till 
the Blood cometh, whilst the Ten Commandments have no 
more authority with us, than if they were so many obsolete 
Laws or Proclamations out of date; he thinketh that a Nation 
will hardly be mended by Principles of Religion, where 
Morality is made a Heresy; and therefore as he believeth 
Devotion misplaced when it gets into a Conventicle, he con- 
cludeth that Loyalty is so too, when lodg'd in a Drunken Club; 
those Vertues deserve a better Seat of Empire, and they are 
degraded, when such Men undertake their defence, as have too 
great need of an Apology themselves. 

Our Trimmer wisheth that some knowledge may go along 
with the Zeal on the right side, and that those who are in 
possession of the Pulpit, would quote at least so often the 
Authority of the Scriptures as they do that of the State; there are 
many who borrow too often Arguments from the Government, 
to use against their Adversaries, and neglect those that are 
more proper, and would be more powerful; a Divine groweth 
less, and putteth a diminution on his own Character, when he 
quoteth any Law but that of God Almighty, to get the better 
of those who contest with him; and as it is a sign of a decay'd 
Constitution, when Nature with good diet cannot expel noxious 
Humours without calling Foreign Drugs to her Assistance; 
So it looketh like want of health in a Church, when instead of 
depending upon the power of that Truth which it holdeth, and 
the good Examples of them that teach it, to support it self, and 
to suppress Errors, it should have a perpetual recourse to the 
secular Authority, and even upon the slightest occasions. 

Our Trimmer hath his Objections to the too busy diligence, 
and to the overdoing of some of the dissenting Clergy, and he 
doth as little approve of those of our Church, who wear God 
Almighty's Liveries, as some old Warders in the Tower do the 
King's, who do nothing in their place but receive their Wages 
for it; he thinketh that the Liberty of the late times gave men 
so much Light, and diffused it so universally amongst the 
people, that they are not now to be dealt with, as they might 
have been in Ages of less enquiry; and therefore tho in some 
well chosen and dearly beloved Auditories, good resolute Non- 
sense back'd with Authority may prevail, yet generally Men 
are become so good Judges of what they hear, that the Clergy 
ought to be very wary how they go about to impose upon their 
Understandings, which are grown less humble than they were 
in former times, when the Men in black had made Learning such 
a sin in the Laity, that for fear of offending, they made a Con- 
science of being able to read; but now the World is grown 
sawcy, and expecteth Reasons, and good ones too, before they 
give up their own Opinions to other Mens Dictates, tho never 
so Magisterially delivered to them. 

Our Trimmer is far from approving the Hypocrisie, which 
seemeth to be the reigning Vice amongst some of the Dissenting 
Clergy, he thinketh it the most provoking sin Men can be 
guilty of, in Relation to Heaven, and yet (which may seem 
strange) that very sin which shall destroy the Soul of the Man 
who preacheth, may help to save those of the Company that 
hear him, and even those who are cheated by the false Ostenta- 
tion of his strictness of life, may by that Pattern be encouraged 
to the real Practice of those Christian Vertues which he doth 
so deceitfully profess; so that the detestation of this fault may 
possibly be carry'd on too far by our own Orthodox Divines, if 
they think it cannot be enough expressed without bending the 
Stick another way; a dangerous Method, and a worse Extream 
for Men of that Character, who by going to the outmost line 
of Christian Liberty, will certainly encourage others to go 
beyond it; No Man doth less approve the ill-bred Methods 
of some of the Dissenters, in rebuking Authority, who behave 
themselves as if they thought ill manners necessary to Salvation; 
yet he cannot but distinguish and desire a Mean between the 
sawcyness of some of the Scotch Apostles, and the undecent 
Courtship of some of the Silken Divines, who, one would think, 
do practice to bow at the Altar, only to learn to make the better 
Legs at Court. 

Our Trimmer approveth the Principles of our Church, that 
Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that our Obedience is 
to be given to a Popish King in other things, at the same time 
that our Compliance with him in his Religion is to be deny'd; 
yet he cannot but think it a very extraordinary thing if a 
Protestant Church should by a voluntary Election, chuse a 
Papist for their Guardian, and receive Directions for support- 
ing their Religion, from one who must believe it a Mortal Sin 
not to endeavour to destroy it; such a refined piece of Breeding 
would not seem to be very well plac'd in the Clergy, who will 
hardly find Precedents to justify such an extravagant piece of 
Courtship, and which is so unlike the Primitive Methods, 
which ought to be our Pattern; he hath no such unreasonable 
tenderness for any sorts of Men, as to expect their faults should 
not be impartially laid open as often as they give occasion for 
it; and yet he cannot but smile to see that the same Man, who 
setteth up all the Sails of his Rhetorick, to fall upon the Dis- 
senters, when Popery is to be handled, he doth it so gingerly, 
that he looketh like an Ass mumbling of Thistles, so afraid he 
is of letting himself loose where he may be in danger of letting 
his Duty get the better of his Discretion. 

Our Trimmer is far from relishing the impertinent wandrings 
of those who pour out long Prayers upon the Congregation, 
and all from their own Stock, which God knoweth, for the most 
part is a barren Soil, which produceth weeds instead of Flowers, 
and by this means they expose Religion it self, rather than 
promote Mens Devotions: On the other side, there may be 
too great Restraint put upon Men, whom God and Nature 
hath distinguished from their Fellow Labourers, by blessing 
them with a happier Talent, and, by giving them not only good 
Sense, but a powerful Utterance too, hath enabled them to gush 
out upon the attentive Auditory, with a mighty stream of 
Devout and unaffected Eloquence; when a Man so qualified, 
endued with Learning too, and above all, adorn'd with a good 
Life, breaketh out into a warm and well delivered Prayer before 
his Sermon, it hath the appearance of a Divine Rapture; he 
raiseth and leadeth the Hearts of the Assembly in another 
manner, than the most Compos'd or best Studied Form of set 
Words can ever do; and the Pray-wees, who serve up all their 
Sermons with the same Garnishing, would look like so many 
Statues, or Men of Straw in the Pulpit, compared with those 
who speak with such a powerful Zeal, that men are tempted 
at the moment to believe Heaven it self hath dictated their 
words to 'em. 

Our Trimmer is not so unreasonably indulgent to the Dis- 
senters, as to excuse the Irregularities of their Complaints, and 
to approve their threatning Stiles, which are so ill-suited to their 
Circumstances as well as to their Duty; he would have them 
to shew their Grief, and not their Anger to the Government, 
and by such a Submission to Authority, as becometh them, 
if they cannot acquiesce in what is imposed, let them deserve 
a Legislative Remedy to their Sufferings, there being no other 
way to give them perfect redress; and either to seek it, or 
pretend to give it by any other Method, would not only be 
vain, but Criminal too in those that go about it; yet with all 
this, there may in the mean time be a prudential Latitude left, 
as to the manner of prosecuting the Laws now in force against 
them: The Government is in some degree answerable for 
such an Administration of them, as may be free from the 
Censure of Impartial Judges; and in order to that, it would 
be necessary that one of these methods be pursued, either to 
let loose the Laws to their utmost extent, without any Modera- 
tion or Restraint, in which at least the Equality of the Govern- 
ment would be without Objection, the Penalties being exacted 
without Remission from the Dissenters of all kinds; or if that 
will not be done (and indeed there is no Reason it should) there 
is a necessity of some Connivance to the Protestant Dissenters 
to excuse that which in Humanity must be allowed to the 
Papists, even without any leaning towards them, which must 
not be supposed in those who are or shall be in the administra- 
tion of publick Business; and it will follow that, according to 
our Circumstances, the distribution of such connivance must 
be made in such a manner, that the greatest part of it may fall 
on the Protestant side, or else the Objections will be so strong, 
and the Inferences so clear, that the Friends, as well as the 
Enemies of the Crown, will be sure to take hold of them. 

It will not be sufficient to say that the Papists may be 
conniv'd at, because they are good Subjects and that the 
Protestant Dissenters must suffer because they are ill ones; 
these general Maxims will not convince discerning Men, neither 
will any late Instances make them forget what passed at other 
times in the World; both sides have had their Turns in being 
good and ill Subjects. And therefore 'tis easie to imagine what 
suspicions would arise in the present conjuncture, if such a 
partial Argument as this should be impos'd upon us; the truth 
is, this Matter speaks so much of it self, that it is not only 
unnecessary, but it may be unmannerly to say any more 
of it. 

Our Trimmer therefore could wish, that since notwithstanding 
the Laws which deny Churches to say Mass in, not only the 
Exercise, but also the Ostentation of Popery is as well or better 
performed in the Chappels of so many Foreign Ministers, where 
the English openly resort in spight of Proclamations and Orders 
of Council, which are grown to be as harmless things to them, 
as the Popes Bulls and Excommunications are to Hereticks 
who are out of his reach; I say he could wish that by a 
seasonable as well as an equal piece of Justice, there might 
be so much consideration had of the Protestant Dissenters, as 
that there might be at some times, and at some places, a Veil 
thrown over an Innocent and retired Conventicle; and that 
such an Indulgence might be practised with less prejudice to 
the Church, or diminution to the Laws, it might be done so as 
to look rather like a kind Omission to enquire more strictly, 
than an allowed Toleration of that which is against the Rule 
established. 

Such a skilful hand as this is very Necessary in our Circum- 
stances, and the Government by making no sort of Men entirely 
desperate, doth not only secure it self from Villainous attempts, 
but lay such a Foundation for healing and uniting Laws, when 
ever a Parliament shall meet, that the Seeds of Differences and 
Animosities between the several contending sides may (Heaven 
consenting) be for ever destroyed. 



The Trimmer's Opinion concerning the Papists. 

To speak of Popery leadeth me into such a Sea of Matter, that 
it is not easie to forbear launching into it, being invited by 
such a fruitful Theme, and by a variety never to be exhausted; 
but to confine it to the present Subject, I will only say a short 
word of the Religion it self; of its influences here at this time; 
and of our Trimmer's Opinion in Relation to our manner of 
living with them. 

If a Man would speak Maliciously of this Religion, one may 
say it is like those Diseases, where as long as one drop of the 
infection remaineth, there is still danger of having the whole 
Mass of Blood corrupted by it. In Swedeland there was an 
absolute cure, and nothing of Popery heard of, till Queen 
Christina, (whether mov'd by Arguments of this or the other 
World may not be good Manners to enquire) thought fit to 
change her Religion and Country, and to live at Rome, where 
she might find better judges of her Virtues, and less ungentle 
Censures of those Princely Liberties to which she was some- 
times disposed, than she left at Stockholme, where the good 
breeding is as much inferior to that of Rome in general, as the 
Civility of the Religion, the Cardinals having rescued the Church 
from those Clownish Methods the Fishermen had first intro- 
duc'd, and mended that Pattern so effectually, that a Man of 
that Age, if he should now come into the World, would not 
possibly know it. 

In Denmark the Reformation was entire; in some States of 
Germany, as well as Geneva, the Cure was universal; but in 
the rest of the World where the Protestant Religion took place, 
the Popish humour was too tough to be totally expell'd, and so 
it was in England, tho' the Change was made with all the 
advantage imaginable to the Reformation, it being Countenanced 
and introduced by Legal Authority, and by that means, might 
have been perhaps as perfect as in any other Place, if the short 
Reign of Edward the 6th, and the succession of a Popish Queen 
had not given such advantage to that Religion, that it hath 
subsisted ever since under all the hardships that have been put 
upon it; it hath been a strong Compact Body, and made the 
more so by these Sufferings; it was not strong enough to pre- 
vail, but it was able, with the help of foreign support, to carry 
on an Interest which gave the Crown trouble, and to make 
a considerable (not to say dangerous) Figure in the Nation; 
so much as this could not have been done without some hopes, 
nor these hopes kept up without some reasonable grounds: In 
Queen Elizabeth's time, the Spanish Zeal for their Religion, 
and the Revenge for 88, gave warmth to the Papists here, and 
above all the Right of the Queen of Scots to succeed, was while 
she lived sufficient to give them a better prospect of their 
Affairs: In King James's time their hopes were supported by 
the Treaty of the Spanish Match, and his gentleness towards 
them, which they were ready to interpret more in their own 
Favour, than was either reasonable or became them, so little 
tenderness they have, even where it is most due, if the Interest 
of their Religion cometh in competition with it. 

As for the late King, tho he gave the most glorious Evidence 
that ever Man did of his being a Protestant, yet, by the more 
than ordinary Influence the Queen was thought to have over 
him, and it so happening that the greatest part of his Anger 
was directed against the Puritans, there was such an advantage 
to Men dispos'd to suspect, that they were ready to interpret 
it a leaning towards Popery, without which handle it was 
Morally impossible, that the ill-affected part of the Nation 
could ever have seduc'd the rest into a Rebellion. 

That which help'd to confirm many well meaning Men in 
their Misapprehensions of the King, was the long and unusual 
intermission of Parliaments; so that every year that passed 
without one, made up a new Argument to increase their 
Suspicion, and made them presume that the Papists had a 
principal hand in keeping them off; This raised such Heats 
in Mens Minds, to think that Men who were obnoxious to the 
Laws, instead of being punished, should have Credit enough 
to secure themselves, even at the price of destroying the 
Fundamental Constitution, that it broke out into a Flame, 
which before it could be quenched, had almost reduced the 
Nation to Ashes. 

Amongst the miserable Effects of that unnatural War, none 
hath been more fatal to us, than the forcing our Princes to 
breathe in another Air, and to receive the early impressions of 
a Foreign Education; the Barbarity of the English, towards 
the King and the Royal Family, might very well tempt him 
to think the better of every thing he found abroad, and might 
naturally produce more gentleness, at least, towards a Religion 
by which he was hospitably received, at the same time that he 
was thrown off and Persecuted by the Protestants, (tho' his 
own Subjects, to aggravate the Offence). The Queen Mother, 
(as generally Ladies do with Age) grew most devout and earnest 
in her Religion; and besides the temporal Rewards of getting 
larger Subsidies from the French Clergy, she had Motives of 
another kind, to perswade her to shew her Zeal; and since by 
the Roman Dispensatory, a Soul converted to the Church is 
a Soveraign Remedy, and layeth up a mighty stock of merit, 
she was solicitous to secure her self in all Events, and there- 
fore first set upon the Duke of Glocester, who depended so 
much upon her good will, that she might for that reason have 
been induc'd to believe, the Conquest would not be difficult; 
but it so fell out, that he either from his own Constancy, or 
that he had those near him by whom he was otherways advis'd, 
chose rather to run away from her importunity, than by staying 
to bear the continual weight of it: It is believ'd she had better 
success with another of her Sons, who, if he was not quite 
brought off from our Religion, at least such beginnings were 
made, as made them very easie to be finished; his being of 
a generous and aspiring Nature, and in that respect, less patient 
in the drudgery of Arguing, might probably help to recommend 
a Church to him that exempts the Laity from the vexation 
of enquiring; perhaps he might (tho by mistake) look upon 
that Religion as more favourable to the enlarged Power of 
Kings, a consideration which might have its weight with a 
young Prince in his warm blood, and that was brought up 
in Arms. 

I cannot hinder my self from a small digression, to consider 
with admiration, that the old Lady of Rome, with all her 
wrinkles, should yet have Charms, able to subdue great Princes; 
so far from handsome, and yet so imperious; so painted, and 
yet so pretending; after having abus'd, depos'd, and murther'd 
so many of her Lovers, she still findeth others glad and proud 
of their new Chains; a thing so strange to indifferent Judges, 
that those who will allow no other Miracles in the Church of 
Rome, must needs grant that this is one not to be contested; 
she sitteth in her Shop, and selleth at dear Rates her Rattles 
and her Hobby-Horses, whilst the deluded World still con- 
tinueth to furnish her with Customers. 

But whither am I carried with this Contemplation? it is 
high time to return to my Text, and to consider the wonderful 
manner of the Kings coming home again, led by the hand of 
Heaven, and called by the Voice of his own People, who 
received him, if possible, with Joys equal to the Blessing of 
Peace and Union which his Restauration brought along with 
it; by this there was an end put to the hopes some might have 
abroad, of making use of his less happy Circumstances, to 
throw him into Foreign Interests and Opinions, which had 
been wholly inconsistent with our Religion, our Laws, and all 
other things that are dear to us; yet for all this some of those 
Tinctures and impressions might so far remain as, tho' they 
were very innocent in him, yet they might have ill effects here, 
by softning the Animosity which seemeth necessary to the 
Defender of the Protestant Faith, in opposition to such a 
powerful and irreconcilable an Enemy. 

You may be sure, that among all the sorts of Men who 
apply'd themselves to the King at his first coming home, for 
his Protection, the Papists were not the last, nor as they fain 
would have flattered themselves, the least welcome, having 
their past Sufferings, as well as their present Professions to 
recommend them; and there was something that looked like 
a particular Consideration of them, since it so happened, that 
the Indulgence promised to Dissenters at Breda, was carried on 
in such a manner, that the Papists were to divide with them; 
and tho' the Parliament, notwithstanding its Resignation to 
the Crown in all things, rejected with scorn and anger a 
Declaration fram'd for this purpose, yet the Birth and steps 
of it gave such an alarm, that Mens suspicions once raised, 
were not easily laid asleep again. 

To omit other things, the breach of the Tripple League, and 
the Dutch War with its appurtenances, carried Jealousies to 
the highest pitch imaginable, and fed the hopes of one Party 
and the fears of the Other to such a degree, that some Critical 
Revolutions were generally expected, when the ill success of 
that War, and the Sacrifice France thought fit to make of the 
Papists here to their own interest abroad, gave them another 
Check; and the Act of enjoyning the Test to all in Offices, 
was thought to be no ill Bargain to the Nation, tho' bought 
at the Price of 1200000 pound, and the Money apply'd to 
continue the War against the Dutch, than which nothing could 
be more unpopular or less approved. Notwithstanding these 
discouragements, Popery is a Plant that may be mowed 
down, but the Root will still remain, and in spite of the Laws, 
it will sprout up and grow again; especially if it should 
happen that there should be Men in Power, who in weeding 
it out of our Garden, will take care to Cherish and keep it 
alive; and tho' the Law for excluding them from Places of 
Trust was tolerably kept as to their outward Form, yet there 
were many Circumstances, which being improved by the quick- 
sighted Malice of ill affected Men, did help to keep up the 
World in their suspicions, and to blow up Jealousies to such 
a height both in and out of Parliament, that the remembrance 
of them is very unpleasant, and the Example so extravagant, 
that it is to be hop'd nothing in our Age like it will be re- 
attempted; but to come closer to the Case in question: in this 
Condition we stand with the Papists, what shall now be done, 
according to our Trimmer's Opinion, in order to the better 
Bearing this grievance, since as I have said before, there is no 
hopes of being entirely free from it; Papists we must have 
among us, and if their Religion keep them from bringing 
honey to the Hive, let the Government try at least by gentle 
means to take away the Sting from them. The first Founda- 
tion to be laid is, that a distinct Consideration is to be had 
of the Popish Clergy, who have such an eternal Interest against 
all accommodation, that it is a hopeless thing to propose any 
thing to them less than all; their Stomachs have been set for 
it ever since the Reformation, they have pinned themselves to 
a Principal that admits no mean: they believe Protestants 
will be damn'd, and therefore by an extraordinary Effect of 
Christian Charity, they would destroy one half of England that 
the other might be saved; then for this World, they must be 
in possession for God Almighty, to receive his Rents for him, 
not to accompt till the Day of Judgment, which is a good 
kind of Tenure, and ye cannot well blame the good Men, that 
will stir up the Laity to run any hazard in order to the getting 
them restored. What is it to the Priest, if the deluded Zealot 
undoeth himself in the Attempt? he singeth Masses as jollily, 
and with as good a Voice at Rome or St. Omers as ever he 
did; is a single Man, and can have no wants but such as 
may be easily supply'd, yet that he may not seem altogether 
insensible, or ungrateful to those that are his Martyrs, he is 
ready to assure their Executors, and if they please, will procure 
a Grant sub Annulo Piscatoris, that the good Man by being 
hanged, hath got a good Bargain, and sav'd the singeing of 
some hundred of years, which he would else have had in 
Purgatory. There's no Cure for this Order of Men, no Ex- 
pedient to be propos'd, so that tho the utmost severity of 
the Laws against them may in some sort be mitigated, yet no 
Treaty can be made with Men who in this Case have left them- 
selves no free Will, but are so muffled by Zeal, tyed by Vows, 
and kept up by such unchangeable Maxims of the Priesthood, 
that they are to be left as desperate Patients, and look'd upon 
as Men that will continue in an Eternal State of Hostility, till 
the Nation is entirely subdued to them. It is then only the 
Lay Papists that are capable of being treated with, and we are 
to examine of what temper they are, and what Arguments are 
the most likely to prevail upon them, and how far 'tis advise- 
able for the Government to be Indulgent to them; the Lay 
Papists generally keep their Religion, rather because they will 
not break Company with those of their Party, than out of any 
settled Zeal that hath Root in them; most of them do by the 
Mediation of the Priests Marry amongst one another, to keep 
up an Ignorant Position by hearing only one side; others by 
a mistake look upon it as they do upon Escutcheons, the more 
Antient Religion of the two; and as some Men of a good 
Pedigree will despise meaner Men, tho' never so much superior 
to them by Nature, so these undervalue Reformation as an 
Upstart, and think there is more Honour in supporting an old 
Errour, than in embracing what seemeth to them to be a new 
Truth; the Laws have made them Men of Pleasure, by ex- 
cluding them from Publick Business, and it happeneth well 
they are so, since they will the more easily be perswaded by 
Arguments of Ease and Conveniency to them; they have not 
put off the Man in general, nor the Englishman in particular, 
those who in the late storm against them went into other 
Countries, tho they had all the Advantage that might recom- 
mend them to a good Reception, yet in a little time they chose 
to steal over again, and live here with hazard, rather than 
abroad with security. There is a Smell in our Native Earth, 
better than all the Perfumes in the East; there is something 
in a Mother, tho never so Angry, that the Children will more 
naturally trust Her, than the Studied Civilities of Strangers, 
let them be never so Hospitable; therefore 'tis not adviseable 
nor agreeing with the Rules of Governing Prudence, to provoke 
Men by hardships to forget that Nature, which else is sure to 
be of our side. 

When these Men by fair Usage are put again into their right 
Senses, they will have quite differing Reflections from those 
which Rigour and Persecution had raised in them: A Lay 
Papist will first consider his Abby-Lands, which notwithstand- 
ing whatever hath or can be alledged, must sink considerably in 
the Value, the moment that Popery prevails; and it being a 
disputable Matter, whether Zeal might not in a little time get 
the better of the Law in that case, a considering Man will 
admit that as an Argument to perswade him to be content with 
things as they are, rather than run this or any other hazard by 
Change, in which perhaps he may have no other Advantage, 
than that his now humble Confessor may be rais'd to a 
Bishoprick, and from thence look down superciliously upon 
his Patron, or which is worse, run to take Possession for God 
Almighty of his Abby, in such a manner as the usurping Land- 
lord (as he will then be called) shall hardly be admitted to be 
so much as a Tenant to his own Lands, lest his Title should 
prejudge that of the Church, which will then be the Landlord; 
he will think what disadvantage 'tis to be looked upon as a 
separate Creature, depending upon a Foreign Interest and 
Authority, and for that reason, expos'd to the Jealousie and 
Suspicion of his Country-men; he will reflect what an Incuni- 
brance it is to have his House a Pasture for hungry Priests to 
graze in, which have such a never-failing Influence upon the 
Foolish, which is the greatest part of every Man's Family, that 
a Man's Dominion, even over his own Children, is mangled, 
and divided, if not totally undermin'd by them; then to be 
subject to what Arbitrary Taxes the Popish Convocation shall 
impose upon him for the carrying on the Common Interest of 
that Religion, under Penalty of being mark'd out for half an 
Heretick by the rest of the Party; to have no share in Business, 
no opportunity of shewing his own Value to the World; to live 
at the best an useless, and by others to be thought a dangerous 
Member of the Nation where he is born, is a burthen to a 
generous Mind that cannot be taken off by all the Pleasure of a 
lazy unmanly life, or by the nauseous enjoyment of a dull Plenty, 
that produceth no food for the Mind, which will be considered 
in the first place by a Man that hath a Soul; when he shall 
think, that if his Religion, after his wading through a Sea of 
Blood, come at last to prevail, it would infinitely lessen, if 
not entirely destroy the Glory, Riches, Strength and Liberty 
of his own Country, and what a Sacrifice is this to make to 
Rome, where they are wise enough to wonder there should be 
such Fools in the World, as to venture, struggle, and contend, 
nay even die Martyrs for that which, should it succeed, would 
prove a Judgment instead of a Blessing to them; he will con- 
clude that the advantages of throwing some of their Children 
back again to God Almighty when they have too many of them, 
are not equal to the Inconveniencies they may either feel or fear, 
by continuing their separation from the Religion established. 

Temporal things will have their weight in the World, and 
tho Zeal may prevail for a time, and get the better in a Skir- 
mish, yet the War endeth generally on the side of Flesh and 
Blood, and will do so till Mankind is another thing than it is at 
present: And therefore a wise Papist in cold Blood, considering 
these and many other Circumstances, which 'twill be worth his 
pains to see if he can unmuffle himself from the Mask of 
Infallibility, will think it reasonable to set his Imprison'd Senses 
at Liberty, and that he hath a right to see with his own Eyes, 
hear with his own Ears, and judge by his own Reason; the 
consequence of which might probably be, that weighing things 
in a right Scale, and seeing them in their true Colours, he 
would distinguish between the merit of suffering for a good 
Cause, and the foolish ostentation of drawing inconveniences 
upon himself; and therefore will not be unwilling to be convinced 
that our Protestant Creed may make him happy in the other 
World, and the easier in this. A few of such wise Proselytes 
would by their Example draw so many after them, that the 
Party would insensibly melt away, and in a little time, without 
any angry word, we should come to an Union that all Good 
Men would have Reason to rejoyce at; but we are not to pre- 
sume upon these Conversions, without preparing Men for them 
by kind and reconciling Arguments; nothing is so against our 
Nature, as to believe those can be in the right who are too hard 
upon us; there is a deformity in every thing that doth us hurt, 
it will look scurvily in our Eye while the smart continueth, and 
a Man must have an extraordinary Measure of Grace, to think 
well of a Religion that reduceth him and his Family to Misery; 
in this respect our Trimmer would consent to the mitigation 
of such Laws as were made (as it is said King Henry VIII. got 
Queen Elizabeth) in a heat against Rome: It may be said that 
even States as well as private Men are subject to Passion; a just 
indignation of a villainous Attempt produceth at the same time 
such Remedies, as perhaps are not without some mixture of 
Revenge, and therefore tho time cannot Repeal a Law, it may 
by a Natural Effect soften the Execution of it; there is less 
danger to Rouse a Lyon when at Rest, than to awake Laws that 
were intended to have their times of Sleeping, nay more than 
that, in some Cases their Natural periods of Life, dying of them- 
selves without the Solemnity of being revoked any otherwise 
than by the common consent of Mankind, who do cease to 
Execute when the Reasons in great Measure fail that first 
Created and Justify'd the Rigour of such unusual Penalties. 

Our Trimmer is not eager to pick out some places in His- 
tory against this or any other Party; quite contrary, is very 
sollicitous to find out any thing that may be healing, and tend 
to an Agreement; but to prescribe the means of this Gentleness 
so as to make it effectual, must come from the only place that 
can furnish Remedies for this Cure, viz. a Parliament; in the 
mean time, it is to be wished there may be such a mutual calm- 
ness of Mind, as that the Protestants might not be so jealous, 
as still to smell the Match that was to blow up the King and 
both Houses in the Gunpowder Treason, or to start at every 
appearance of Popery, as if it were just taking Possession. On 
the other side, let not the Papists suffer themselves to be led 
by any hopes, tho never so flattering, to a Confidence or Osten- 
tation which must provoke Men to be less kind to them; let 
them use Modesty on their sides, and the Protestants Indul- 
gence on theirs; and by this means there would be an over- 
looking of all Venial Faults, a tacit connivence at all things that 
do not carry Scandal with them, and would amount to a kind 
of Natural Dispensation with the severe Laws, since there would 
be no more Accusers to be found, when the occasions of Anger 
and Animosity are once remov'd; let the Papists in the mean 
time remember, that there is a respect due from all lesser 
numbers to greater, a deference to be paid by an Opinion that 
is Exploded, to one that is Established; such a Thought well 
digested will have an influence upon their Behaviour, and pro- 
duce such a Temper as must win the most eager Adversaries out 
of their ill Humour to them, and give them a Title to all the 
Favour that may be consistent with the Publick Peace and 
Security. 



The Trimmer's Opinion in Relation to things abroad. 

The World is so composed, that it is hard, if not impossible, 
for a Nation not to be a great deal involved in the fate of 
their Neighbours, and tho by the felicity of our Situation, we 
are more Independant than any other People, yet we have in all 
Ages been concerned for our own sakes in the Revolutions 
abroad. There was a time when England was the over 
balancing Power of Christendom, and that either by Inheritance 
or Conquest, the better part of France received Laws from us; 
after that we being reduc'd into our own Limits, France and 
Spain became the Rivals for the Universal Monarchy, and our 
third Power, tho in it self less than either of the other, hapned 
to be Superiour to any of them, by that choice we had of throw- 
ing the Scales on that side to which we gave our Friendship. I 
do not know whether this Figure did not make us as great as 
our former Conquest; to be a perpetual Umpire of two great 
contending Powers, who gave us all their Courtship, and offer'd 
all their Incense at our Altar, whilst the Fate of either Prince 
seemed to depend upon the Oracles we delivered; for the King 
of England to sit on his Throne, as in the Supream Court of 
Justice, to which the two great Monarchs appeal, pleading their 
Cause, and expecting their Sentence declaring which side was 
in the right, or at least if we pleas'd which side should have the 
better of it, was a piece of Greatness which was peculiar to us, 
and no wonder if we endeavoured to preserve it, as we did for 
a considerable time, it being our Safety, as well as Glory, to 
maintain it; but by a Fatality upon our Councils, or by the re- 
fin'd Policy of this latter Age, we have thought fit to use 
industry to destroy this mighty Power, which we have so long 
enjoyed; and that equality between the Two Monarchs, which 
we might for ever have preserved, hath been chiefly broken by 
us, whose Interest it was above all others to maintain it; when 
one of them, like the overflowing of the Sea, had gained more 
upon the other than our convenience, or indeed our safety, 
would allow, instead of mending the Banks, or making new 
ones, we our selves with our own hands helpt to cut them, to 
invite and make way for a farther Inundation. France and 
Spain have had their several turns in making use of our Mistakes, 
and we have been formerly as deaf to the Instances of the then 
weaker part of the World to help them against the House of 
Austria, as we can now be to the Earnestness of Spain, that we 
would assist them against the Power of France. Gondamar was 
as sawcy, and as powerful too in King James his Court, as any 
French Ambassadour can have been at any time since; Men 
talked as wrong then on the Spanish side, and made their Court 
by it as well as any can have done since by talking as much for 
the French; so that from that time, instead of weighing in 
a wise Balance the power of either Crown, it looketh as if we 
had learnt only to weigh the Pensions, and take the heaviest. 

It would be tedious, as well as unwelcome, to recapitulate all 
our wrong steps, so that I will go no farther than the King's 
Restauration, at which time the Balance was on the side of 
France, and that by the means of Cromwell, who for a separate 
Interest of his own had sacrificed that of the Nation, by joining 
with the stronger side, to suppress the Power of Spain, which 
he ought to have supported. Such a Method was natural 
enough to an Usurper, and shew'd he was not the Lawful Father 
of the People, by his having so little care of them; and the 
Example coming from that hand, one would think should, for 
that Reason, be less likely to be followed. But to go on, home 
cometh the King, followed with Courtships from all Nations 
abroad, of which some did it not only to make them forget how 
familiarly they had us'd him when he was in other Circumstances, 
but to bespeak the Friendship of a Prince, who besides his other 
Greatness, was yet more considerable by being re-established by 
the love of his people. France had an Interest either to dispose 
us to so much good will, or at least to put us into such a Con- 
dition, that we might give no Opposition to their Designs; and 
Flanders being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a lasting Beauty 
for which they have an incurable passion, and not being kind 
enough to consent to them, they meditated to commit a Rape 
upon her, which they thought would not be easie to do, while 
England and Holland were agreed to rescue her, when-ever they 
should hear her cry out for help to them; to this end they put 
in practice Seasonable and Artificial Whispers, to widen things 
between us and the States. Amboyna and the Fishery must be 
talk'd of here; the freedom of the Seas, and the preservation of 
Trade must be insinuated there; and there being combustible 
matter on both sides, in a little time it took Fire, which gave 
those that kindled it, sufficient cause to smile and hug them- 
selves, to see us both fall into the Net they had laid for us. And 
it is observable and of good example to us, if we will take it, 
That their Design being to set us together at Cuffs to weaken 
us, they kept themselves Lookers-on till our Victories began to 
break the Balance; then the King of France, like a wise Prince, 
was resolved to support the beaten side, and would no more let 
the Power of the Sea, than we ought to suffer the Monarchy of 
Europe, to fall into one hand: In pursuance to this, he took 
part with the Dutch, and in a little time made himself Umpire 
of the Peace between us; some time after, upon pretence of his 
Queen's Title to part of Flanders, by Right of Devolution, he 
falleth into it with a mighty Force, for which the Spaniard was 
so little prepared, that he made a very swift Progress, and 
had such a Torrent of undisputed Victory, that England and 
Holland, tho the Wounds they had given one another were yet 
green, being struck with the apprehension of so near a danger 
to them, thought it necessary, for their own defence, to make 
up a sudden League, into which Sweden was taken to interpose 
for a Peace between the two Crowns. 

This had so good an effect, that France was stopt in its Career, 
and the Peace of Aix le Chapelle was a little after concluded. 
'Twas a forc'd put; and tho France wisely dissembled their 
inward dissatisfaction, yet from that very moment they resolv'd 
to unty the Triple knot, whatever it cost them; for his 
Christian Majesty, after his Conquering Meals, ever riseth 
with a stomach, and he lik'd the Pattern so well, that it gave 
him a longing desire to have the whole Piece. Amongst the 
other means used for the attaining this end, the sending over 
the Dutchess of Orleans, was not the least powerful; she was 
a very welcome Guest here, and her own Charms and Dexterity 
joined with other Advantages that might help her perswasions, 
gave her such an Ascendant, that she should hardly fail of 
success. One of the Preliminaries of her Treaty, tho a trivial 
thing in it self, yet was considerable in the Consequence, as 
very small circumstances often are in relation to the Government 
of the World. About this time a general Humour, in opposition 
to France, had made us throw off their Fashion, and put on 
Vests, that we might look more like a distinct People, and not 
be under the servility of imitation, which ever payeth a greater 
deference to the Original, than is consistent with the Equality 
all Independent Nations should pretend to; France did not 
like this small beginning of ill Humours, at least of Emulation, 
and wisely considering that it is a natural Introduction first to 
make the World their Apes, that they may be afterwards their 
Slaves, it was thought that one of the Instructions Madam 
brought along with her, was to laugh us out of these Vests; 
which she performed so effectually, that in a moment, like so 
many Footmen who had quitted their Masters Livery, we all 
took it again, and returned to our old Service; so that the very 
time of doing it gave a very critical Advantage to France, since 
it lookt like an Evidence of our returning to their Interest, as 
well as to their Fashion, and would give such a distrust of us 
to our new Allies, that it might facilitate the dissolution of the 
knot, which tied them so within their bounds, that they were 
very impatient till they were freed from the restraint. 

But the Lady had a more extended Commission than this and 
without doubt laid the Foundation of a new strict Alliance, 
quite contrary to the other in which we had been so lately 
engaged. And of this there were such early appearances, that 
the World began to look upon us as falling into Apostacy from 
the common Interest. Notwithstanding all this, France did 
not neglect at the same time to give good words to the Dutch, 
and even to feed them with hopes of supporting them against 
us, when on a sudden, that never to be forgotten Declaration of 
War against them cometh out, only to vindicate his own Glory, 
and to revenge the Injuries done to his Brother in England, by 
which he became our Second in this Duel; so humble can this 
Prince be, when at the same time he doth us more Honour than 
we deserve, he layeth a greater share of the blame upon our 
Shoulders, than did naturally belong to us; the particulars of 
that War, our part in it while we staid in it, and when we were 
out of breath, our leaving the French to make an end of it, are 
things too well known to make it necessary, and too unwelcome 
in themselves to incite me to repeat them; only the wisdom of 
France is in this to be observed, That when we had made 
a separate Peace, which left them single to oppose the united 
Force of the Confederates, they were so far from being angry, 
that they would not shew so much as the least coldness, hoping 
to get as much by our Mediation for a Peace, as they would 
have expected from our Assistance in the War, our Circum- 
stances at that time considered; This seasonable piece of 
Indulgence in not reproaching us, but rather allowing those 
Necessities of State which we gave for our Excuse, was such 
an engaging Method, that it went a great way to keep us still 
in their Chains, when, to the Eye of the World, we had abso- 
lutely broke loose from them: And by what pass'd afterwards 
at Nimeguen, tho the King's Neutrality gave him the outward 
Figure of a Mediator, it appear'd that his Interposition was 
extremely suspected of Partiality by the Confederates, who upon 
that Ground did both at and before the Conclusion of that 
Treaty, treat his Ministers there with a great deal of neglect. 
In this Peace as well as in that of the Pyreneans and Aix le 
Chapelle, the King of France, at the Moment of making it, had 
the thought of breaking it; for a very little time after he 
broach'd his Pretensions upon Alost', which were things that 
if they had been offer'd by a less formidable hand, would have 
been smiled at; but ill Arguments being seconded by good 
Armies, carry such a power with them, that naked sense is 
a very unequal Adversary. It was thought that these airy 
Claims were chiefly rais'd with the prospect of getting Luxen- 
burg for the Equivalent; and this Opinion was confirmed by the 
blocking it up afterwards, pretending to the Country of Chimay, 
that it might be entirely surrounded by the French Dominions, 
and it was so pressed that it might have fallen in a little time, 
if the King of France had not sent Orders to his Troops to 
retire, and his Christian Generosity which was assign 'd for the 
reason of it, made the World smile, since it is seen how differently 
his devout Zeal worketh in Hungary: that specious Reason 
was in many respects ill-tim'd, and France it self gave it so 
faintly, that at the very time it look'd out of Countenance; 
the true ground of his Retiring is worth our observation; for 
at the instance of the Confederates, Offices were done, and 
Memorials given, but all ineffectual till the word Parliament 
was put into them; that powerful word had such an effect, that 
even at that distance it rais'd the Seige, which may convince us of 
what efficacy the King of England's words are, when he will give 
them their full weight, and threaten with his Parliament; it is 
then that he appeareth that great Figure we ought to represent 
him in our Minds, the Nation his Body, he the Head, and joined 
with that Harmony, that every word he pronounceth is the 
Word of a Kingdom: Such words, as appeareth by this 
Example, are as effectual as Fleets and Armies, because they 
can create them, and without this his words sound abroad like 
a faint Whisper, that is either not heard, or (which is worse) 
not minded. But tho France had made this step of forced 
Compliance, it did not mean to leave off the pursuit of their 
pretensions; and therefore immediately proposed the Arbitration 
to the King; but it appeared, that notwithstanding his Merit 
towards the Confederates, in saving Luxenburg, the remem- 
brances of what had passed before, had left such an ill taste in 
their Mouths, that they could not Relish our being put into 
a Condition to dispose of their Interests, and therefore declined 
it by insisting upon a general Treaty, to which France hath 
ever since continued to be averse; our great earnestness also to 
perswade the Confederates to consent to it, was so unusual, and 
so suspicious a method, that it might naturally make them 
believe, that France spake to them by our Mouth, and for that 
Reason, if there had been no other, might hinder the accepting 
it; and so little care hath been taken to cure this or other 
Jealousies the Confederates may have entertain'd, that quite 
contrary, their Ministers here every day take fresh Alarms, 
from what they observe in small, as well as in greater Circum- 
stances; and they being apt both to take and improve appre- 
hensions of this kind, draw such Inferences from them, as make 
them entirely despair of us. 

Thus we now stand, far from being Innocent Spectators of 
our Neighbours Ruine, and by a fatal mistake forgetting what 
a Certain Fore-runner it is to our own; and now it is time our 
Trimmer should tell something of his Opinion, upon this present 
State of things abroad; he first professeth to have no Biass, 
either for or against France, and that his thoughts are wholly 
directed by the Interest of his own Country; he alloweth, and 
hath read that Spain used the same Methods, when it was in 
its heighth, as France doth now, and therefore it is not Partiality 
that moveth him, but the just fear which all reasonable Men 
must be possess'd with, of an over-growing Power; Ambition 
is a devouring Beast, when it hath swallow'd one Province, 
instead of being cloyed, it hath so much the greater Stomach 
to another, and being fed, becometh still the more hungry; so 
that for the Confederates to expect a security from any thing 
but their own united strength, is a most miserable fallacy; and 
if they cannot resist the Incroachments of France by their Arms, 
it is in vain for them to dream of any other means of preserva- 
tion; it would have the better grace, besides the saving so much 
Blood and Ruin, to give up all at once; make a Present of 
themselves, to appease this haughty Monarch, rather than be 
whisper'd, flattered, or cozened out of their liberty. Nothing is 
so soft as the first applications of a greater Prince, to engage 
a weaker, but that smiling Countenance is but a Vizard, it is 
not the true Face; for as soon as their turn is served, the Court- 
ship flies to some other Prince or State, where the same part 
is to be acted over again; leaveth the old mistaken Friend to 
Neglect and Contempt, and like an insolent Lover to a Cast off 
Mistress, Reproaches her with that Infamy, of which he him- 
self was the Author. Sweden, Bavaria, Palatine, &c. may by 
their Fresh Examples, teach other Princes what they are 
reasonably to expect, and what Snakes are hid under the 
Flowers the Court of France so liberally throweth upon them 
whilst they can be useful. The various Methods and deep 
Intrigues, with the differing Notes in several Countries, do not 
only give suspicion, but assurance that every thing is put in 
Practice, by which universal Monarchy may be obtain'd. Who 
can reconcile the withdrawing of his Troops from Luxenburg, in 
consideration of the War in Hungary, which was not then declared, 
and presently after encouraging the Turk to take Vienna, and 
consequently to destroy the Empire? Or who can think that 
the Persecution of the Poor Protestants of France, will be 
accepted of God, as an Atonement for hazarding the loss of 
the whole Christian Faith? Can he be thought in earnest, when 
he seem'd to be afraid of the Spaniards, and for that reason 
must have Luxenburg, and that he cannot be safe from Germany, 
unless he is in possession of Strasburg? All Injustice and 
Violence must in it self be grievous, but the aggravations of 
supporting 'em by false Arguments, and insulting Reasons, has 
something in it yet more provoking than the Injuries them- 
selves; and the World hath ground enough to apprehend, from 
such a Method of arguing, that even their Senses are to be 
subdu'd as well as their Liberties. Then the variety of Argu- 
ments used by France in several Countries is very observable: 
In England and Denmark, nothing insisted on but the Greatness 
and Authority of the Crown; on the other side, the Great Men 
in Poland are commended, who differ in Opinion with the King, 
and they argue like Friends to the Privilege of the Dyet, against 
the separate Power of the Crown: In Sweden they are troubled 
that the King should have changed something there of late, by 
his single Authority, from the antient and settled Authority and 
Constitutions: At Ratisbone, the most Christian Majesty taketh 
the Liberties of all the Electors and free States into his 
Protection, and telleth them the Emperour is a dangerous Man, 
an aspiring Hero, that would infallibly devour them, if he was 
not at hand to resist him on their behalf; but above all in 
Holland, he hath the most obliging tenderness for the Common- 
wealth, and is in such disquiets, lest it should be invaded by the 
Prince of Orange, that they can do no less in gratitude, than 
undo themselves when he bids them, to show how sensible they 
are of his excessive good Nature; yet in spight of all these 
Contradictions, there are in the World such refin'd States-men, 
as will upon their Credit affirm the following Paradoxes to be 
real truth; first that France alone is sincere and keepeth its 
Faith, and consequently that it is the only Friend we can rely 
upon; that the King of France, of all Men living, hath the 
least mind to be a Conqueror; that he is a sleepy, tame 
Creature, void of all Ambition, a poor kind of a Man, that hath 
no farther thoughts than to be quiet; that he is charm'd by his 
Friendship to us; that it is impossible he should ever do us hurt, 
and therefore tho Flanders was lost, it would not in the least 
concern us; that he would fain help the Crown of England to 
be absolute, which would be to take pains to put it into a con- 
dition to oppose him, as it is, and must be our Interest, as 
long as he continueth in such an overbalancing Power and 
Greatness. 

Such a Creed as this, if once received, might prepare our 
belief for greater things, and as he that taught Men to eat 
a Dagger, began first with a Pen knife; so if we can be prevailed 
with to digest the smaller Mistakes, we may at last make our 
stomachs strong enough for that of Transubstantiation. Our 
Trimmer cannot easily be converted out of his senses by these 
State Sophisters, and yet he hath no such peevish Obstinacy as 
to reject all Correspondence with France because we ought to 
be apprehensive of the too great power of it; he would not have 
the kings Friendship to the Confederates extended to the in- 
volving him in any unreasonable or dangerous Engagements, 
neither would he have him lay aside the consideration of his 
better establishment at home, out of his excessive Zeal to secure 
his Allies abroad; but sure there might be a Mean between 
these two opposite Extreams, and it may be wished that our 
Friendship with France should at least be so bounded, that it 
may consist with the humour as well as the Interest of England. 
There is no Woman but hath her fears of contracting too near 
an intimacy with a much greater Beauty, because it exposeth 
her too often to a Comparison that is not advantageous to her; 
and sure it may become a Prince to be as jealous of his Dignity, 
as a Lady can be of her good looks, and to be as much out of 
Countenance, to be thought an humble Companion to so much 
a greater Power. To be always seen in an ill Light, to be so 
darkned by the brightness of a greater Star, is somewhat morti- 
fying; and when England might ride Admiral at the head of 
the Confederates, to look like the Kitching- Yacht to the Grand 
Louis, is but a scurvy Figure for us to make in the Map of 
Christendom', it would rise upon our Trimmer's stomach, if 
ever (which God forbid) the power of calling and intermitting 
Parliaments here should be transferred to the Crown of France, 
and that all the opportunities of our own settlements at home 
should give way to their Projects abroad, and that our Interests 
should be so far sacrific'd to our Compliance, that all the Omni- 
potence of France can never make us full amends for it. In 
the mean time, he shrinketh at the dismal prospect he can by 
no means drive away from his thoughts, that when France hath 
gathered all the fruit arising from our Mistakes, and that we
can bear no more with them, they will cut down the Tree and 
throw it into the fire. All this while, some Superfine States- 
Men, to comfort us, would fain perswade the World that this 
or that accident may save us, and for all that is or ought to be 
dear to us, would have us to rely wholly upon Chance, not con- 
sidering that Fortune is Wisdoms Creature, and that God 
Almighty loves to be on the Wisest as well as the Strongest side; 
therefore this is such a miserable shift, such a shameful Evasion, 
that they would be laught to death for it, if the ruining Con- 
sequence of this Mistake did not more dispose Men to rage, and 
a detestation of it. 

Our Trimmer is far from Idolatry in other things, in one 
thing only he cometh near it, his Country is in some degree his 
Idol; he doth not Worship the Sun, because 'tis not peculiar to 
us, it rambles about the World, and is less kind to us than 
others; but for the Earth of England, tho perhaps inferior to 
that of many places abroad, to him there is Divinity in it, and 
he would rather dye, than see a spire of English Grass trampled 
down by a Foreign Trespasser: He thinketh there are a great 
many of his mind, for all plants are apt to taste of the Soyl in which 
they grow, and we that grow here, have a Root that produceth 
in us a Stalk of English Juice, which is not to be changed by 
grafting or foreign infusion; and I do not know whether any 
thing less will prevail, than the Modern Experiment, by which 
the Blood of one Creature is transmitted into another; accord- 
ing to which, before the French blood can be let into our 
Bodies, every drop of our own must be drawn out of them. 

Our Trimmer cannot but lament, that by a Sacrifice too great 
for one Nation to make to another, we should be like a rich 
Mine, made useless only for want of being wrought, and that 
the Life and Vigour which should move us against our Enemies 
is miserably apply'd to tear our own Bowels; that being made 
by our happy situation, not only safer, but if we please greater 
too, than other Countries which far exceed us in extent; that 
having Courage by Nature, Learning by Industry, and Riches 
by Trade, we should corrupt all these Advantages, so as to make 
them insignificant, and by a fatality which seemeth peculiar to 
us, misplace our active rage one against another, whilst we are 
turn'd into Statues on that side where lieth our greatest danger; 
to be unconcern' d not only at our Neighbours ruine but our 
own, and let our Island lie like a great Hulk in the Sea, without 
Rudder or Sail, all the Men cast away in her, or as if we were all 
Children in a great Cradle, and rockt asleep to a foreign Tune. 

I say when our Trimmer representeth to his Mind, our 
Roses blasted and discolour'd, whilst the Lilies Triumph and 
grow Insolent upon the Comparison; when he considereth our 
own once flourishing Lawrel, now withered and dying, and 
nothing left us but a remembrance of a better part in History 
than we shall make in the next Age, which will be no more to 
us than an Escutcheon hung upon our Door when we are dead; 
when he foreseeth from hence growing Infamy from abroad, 
confusion at home, and all this without the possibility of a Cure, 
in respect of the voluntary fetters good Men put upon 
themselves by their Allegiance; without a good measure of 
preventing Grace, he would be tempted to go out of the World 
like a Roman Philosopher, rather than endure the burthen of 
Life under such a discouraging Prospect. But Mistakes, as all 
other things, have their Periods, and many times the nearest way 
to Cure, is not to oppose them, but stay till they are crusht with 
their own weight: for Nature will not allow any thing to 
continue long that is violent; violence is a wound, and as a 
wound must be curable in a little time, or else; tis Mortal, but 
a Nation comes near to be Immortal, therefore the wound will 
one time or another be cured, tho perhaps by such rough 
Methods, if too long forborn, as may even make the best 
Remedies we can prepare, to be at the same time a Melancholy 
Contemplation to us; there is but one thing (God Almighties 
Providence excepted) to support a Man from sinking under 
these afflicting thoughts, and that is the hopes we draw singly 
from the King himself, without the mixture of any other 
consideration. 

Tho the Nation was lavish of their Kindness to him at his first 
coming, yet there remaineth still a stock of Warmth in Mens 
Hearts for him. Besides, the good Influences of his happy 
Planet are not yet all spent, and tho the Stars of Men past their 
youth are generally declining, and have less Force, like the Eyes 
of decaying Beauties, yet by a Blessing peculiar to himself, we 
may yet hope to be sav'd by his Autumnal Fortune; He hath 
something about him that will draw down a healing Miracle for 
his and our Deliverance; a Prince which seemeth fitted for such 
an offending Age, in which Mens Crimes have been so general, 
that the not forgiving his People had been the destroying of 
them; whose Gentleness giveth him a natural Dominion that 
hath no bounds, with such a noble mixture of Greatness and 
Condescention, an engaging Look, that disarmeth Men of their ill 
Humours, and their Resentments; something in him that 
wanteth a Name, and can be no more defined than it can be 
resisted; a Gift of Heaven, of its last finishing, where it will be 
peculiarly kind; the only Prince in the World that dares be 
familiar, or that hath right to triumph over those forms which 
were first invented to give awe to those who could not judge, 
and to hide Defects from those that could; a Prince that hath 
exhausted himself by his Liberality, and endangered himself by 
his Mercy; who out-shineth by his own Light and natural 
Virtues all the varnish of studied Acquisitions; his Faults are 
like Shades to a good Picture, or like Allay to Gold, to make 
it the more useful; he may have some, but for any Man to see 
them through so many reconciling Virtues, is a Sacrilegious 
piece of ill nature, of which no generous Mind can be guilty; 
a Prince that deserveth to be lov'd for his own sake, even 
without the help of a Comparison; our Love, our Duty, and 
our Danger all join to cement our Obedience to him; in short, 
whatever he can do, it is no more possible for us to be angry 
with him, than with the Bank that secureth us from the raging 
Sea, the kind Shade that hideth us from the scorching Sun, 
the welcome Hand that reacheth us a Reprieve, or with the 
Guardian Angel, that rescueth our Souls from the devouring 
Jaws of wretched Eternity. 

CONCLUSION 

To Conclude, our Trimmer is so fully satisfy'd of the Truth 
of those Principles by which he is directed in reference to 
the Publick, that he will neither be Bawled, Threatned, Laught, 
nor Drunk out of them; and instead of being converted by the 
Arguments of his Adversaries to their Opinions, he is very 
much confirmed in his own by them; he professeth solemnly 
that were it in his Power to chuse, he would rather have his 
Ambition bounded by the Commands of a Great and Wise 
Master, than let it range with a Popular Licence, tho; crown'd 
with success; yet he cannot commit such a Sin against the 
glorious thing call'd Liberty, nor let his Soul stoop so much 
below it self, as to be content without repining to have his 
Reason wholly subdu'd, or the Privilege of Acting like a sensible 
Creature torn from him by the imperious Dictates of unlimited 
Authority, in what hand soever it happens to be plac'd. What 
is there in this that is so Criminal, as to deserve the Penalty of 
that most singular Apophthegm, A Trimmer is worse than a 
Rebel? What do angry men ail to rail so against Moderation; 
doth it not look as if they were going to some very scurvy 
Extreme, that is too strong to be digested by the more 
considering part of Mankind? These Arbitrary Methods, 
besides the injustice of them, are (God be thanked) very 
unskilful too, for they fright the Birds, by talking so loud, 
from coming into the Nets that are laid for them; and when 
Men agree to rifle a House, they seldom give warning, or blow 
a Trumpet; but there are some small States-Men, who are so 
full charg'd with their own Expectations, that they cannot 
contain. And kind Heaven by sending such a seasonable Curse 
upon their undertakings, hath made their ignorance an Antidote 
against their Malice; some of these cannot treat peaceably; 
yielding will not satisfy them, they will have men by storm; 
there are others, that must have Plots, to make their Service 
more necessary, and have an Interest to keep them alive, since 
they are to live upon them; and perswade the King to retrench 
his own Greatness, so as to shrink into the head of a 
Party, which is the betraying him into such an Unprincely 
mistake, and to such a wilful diminution of himself, that they 
are the last Enemies he ought to allow himself to forgive; such 
Men, if they could, would prevail with the Sun to shine only 
upon them and their Friends, and to leave all the rest of the 
World in the dark; this is a very unusual Monopoly, and may 
come within the Equity of the Law, which maketh it Treason 
to Imprison the King, when such unfitting bounds are put to his 
Favour, and he confin'd to the narrow limits of a particular set 
of Men, that would inclose him; these Honest and only Loyal 
Gentlemen, if they may be allowed to bear Witness for 
themselves, make a King their Engine, and degrade him into a 
property at the very time that their Flattery would make him 
believe they paid Divine Worship to him; besides these there is 
a flying Squadron on both sides, that are afraid the World 
should agree, small dabblers in Conjuring, that raise angry 
Apparitions to keep Men from being reconciled, like Wasps that 
fly up and down, buz and sting to keep Men unquiet; but 
these Insects are commonly short-liv'd Creatures, and no doubt 
in a little time Mankind will be rid of them; they were Gyants 
at least who fought once against Heaven, but for such Pigmies 
as these to contend against it, is such a provoking Folly, that 
the insolent Bunglers ought to be laught and hist out of the 
World for it; they should consider there is a Soul in that great 
body of the People, which may for a time be drowzy and 
unactive, but when the Leviathan is rouz'd, it moveth like an 
angry Creature, and will neither be convinced nor resisted: the 
People can never agree to shew their united Powers, till they 
are extremely tempted and provoked to it, so that to apply 
Cupping-Glasses to a great Beast naturally dispos'd to sleep, 
and to force the Tame thing whether it will or no to be Valiant, 
must be learnt out of some other Book than Machiavil, who 
would never have prescrib'd such a preposterous Method. It is 
to be remembred, that if Princes have Law and Authority on 
their sides, the People on theirs may have Nature, which is a 
formidable Adversary; Duty, Justice, Religion, nay, even 
Humane Prudence too, biddeth the People suffer any thing 
rather than resist; but unconnected Nature, where e're it feels 
the smart will run to the nearest Remedy. Mens Passions in 
this Case are to be considered as well as their Duty, let it be 
never so strongly enforced, for if their Passions are provoked, 
they being as much a part of us as our Limbs, they lead Men 
into a short way of Arguing, that admitteth no distinction, 
and from the foundation of Self-Defence they will draw 
Inferences that will have miserable effects upon the quiet of a 
Government. 

Our Trimmer therefore dreads a general discontent, because 
he thinketh it differeth from a Rebellion, only as a Spotted 
Fever doth from the Plague, the same Species under a lower 
degree of Malignity; it worketh several ways; sometimes like 
a slow Poyson that hath its Effects at a great distance from the 
time it was given, sometimes like dry Flax prepared to catch at 
the first Fire, or like Seed in the ground ready to sprout upon 
the first Shower; in every shape 'tis fatal, and our Trimmer 
thinketh no pains or precaution can be so great as to prevent it. 

In short he thinketh himself in the right, grounding his 
Opinion upon that Truth, which equally hateth to be under the 
Oppressions of wrangling Sophistry of the one hand, or the 
short dictates of mistaken Authority on the other. 

Our Trimmer adoreth the Goddess Truth, tho' in all Ages she 
hath been scurvily used, as well as those that Worshipped her; 
'tis of late become such a ruining Virtue, that Mankind seemeth 
to be agreed to commend and avoid it; yet the want of Practice 
which Repealeth the other Laws, hath no influence upon the 
Law of Truth, because it hath root in Heaven, and an Intrinsick 
value in it self, that can never be impaired; she sheweth her 
Greatness in this, that her Enemies even when they are 
successful are asham'd to own it; nothing but powerful Truth 
hath the prerogative of Triumphing, not only after Victories, 
but in spite of them, and to put Conquest her self out of 
Countenance; she may be kept under and supprest, but her 
Dignity still remaineth with her, even when she is in Chains; 
Falshood with all her Impudence hath not enough to speak ill 
of her before her Face, such Majesty she carrieth about 
her, that her most prosperous Enemies are fain to whisper their 
Treason; all the Power upon Earth can never extinguish her; 
she hath had in all Ages; and let the Mistaken Zeal of 
prevailing Authority christen any opposition to it with what 
Name they please, she maketh it not only an ugly and 
unmannerly, but a dangerous thing to persist; she hath lived 
very retired indeed, nay sometime so buried, that only some few 
of the discerning part of Mankind could have a Glimpse of her; 
with all that she hath Eternity in her, she knoweth not how to 
die, and from the darkest Clouds that shade and cover her, she 
breaketh from time to time with Triumph for her Friends, and 
Terrour to her Enemies. 

Our Trimmer therefore inspired by this Divine Virtue, 
thinketh fit to conclude with these Assertions, That our 
Climate is a Trimmer, between that part of the World where 
men are Roasted, and the other where they are Frozen j That 
our Church is a Trimmer between the Phrenzy of Platonick 
Visions, and the Lethargick Ignorance of Popish Dreams; That 
our Laws are Trimmers, between the Excess of unbounded 
Power, and the Extravagance of Liberty not enough restrained; 
That true Virtue hath ever been thought a Trimmer, and to 
have its dwelling in the middle between the two Extreams; That 
even God Almighty himself is divided between his two great 
Attributes, his Mercy and his Justice. 

In such Company, our Trimmer is not ashamed of his Name, 
and willingly leaveth to the bold Champions of either Extream, 
the Honour of contending with no less Adversaries, than 
Nature, Religion, Liberty, Prudence, Humanity and Common 
Sense.
