natural swelling either of Power or Liberty; and whereas in all 
overgrown Monarchies, Reason, Learning, and Enquiry are 
hang'd in Effigy for Mutineers; here they are encouraged and 
cherished as the surest Friends to a Government establish'd upon 
the Foundation of Law and Justice. When all is done, those 
who look for Perfection in this World, may look as the Jews 
have for their Messias, and therefore our Trimmer is not so un- 
reasonably Partial as to free our Government from all objections; 
no doubt there have been fatal Instances of its Sickness, and 
more than that, of its Mortality, for sometime, tho; by a 
Miracle, it hath been reviv'd again: but till we have another 
race of Mankind, in all Constitutions that are bounded there 
will ever be some matter of Strife and Contention, and rather 
than want pretensions, Mens Passions and Interests will raise 
them from the most inconsiderable Causes. 

Our Government is like our Climate, there are Winds which are 
sometimes loud and unquiet, and yet with all the Trouble they 
give us, we owe great part of our Health unto them, they clear 
the Air, which else would be like a standing Pool and in stead 
of Refreshment would be a Disease unto us. 

There may be fresh Gales of asserting Liberty, without turn- 
ing into such storms of Hurricane, as that the State should run 
any hazard of being Cast away by them; these struglings 
which are natural to all mixed Governments, while they are kept 
from growing into Convulsions, do by a mutual agitation from 
the several parts, rather support and strengthen, than weaken 
or maim the Constitution; and the whole frame, instead of 
being torn or disjointed, cometh to be the better and closer knit 
by being thus exercised; but what ever faults our Government 
may have, or a discerning Critick may find in it, when he 
looketh upon it alone, let any other be set against it, and then 
it sheweth its Comparative Beauty; let us look upon the most 
glittering outside of unbounded Authority, and upon a nearer 
enquiry, we shall find nothing but poor and miserable deformity 
within; let us imagine a Prince living in his Kingdom, as if in 
a great Gaily, his Subjects tugging at the Oar, laden with 
Chains, and reduced to real Rags, that they may gain him
