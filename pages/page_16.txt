O_ergrO_n Mon_Tchies,  Reason,  _e_rnine, and Enquiry a_'_
hang'd in Emgy for Mutineers; here they are encou?.aged and
cherisl_ed as the sul'est _riends to a GoveI.nmeI_t establish'd upon
the Foundation of La_ and Justice.  WheI_ all is done, thos_

reasonably Partial as, to f_'ee our Governn_ent from _ll ob_ectiuns;
no duubt thel'e have been f_t_l Instances of its Sichness, and
more than  thc_t, of its  MortL_lity, for so_netin_e,  tho'  by a'
