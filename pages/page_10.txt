as to be Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone; for when he 
is reduc'd to the single definition of a man, he sinketh into 
so low a Character, that it is a temptation upon Mens 
Allegiance, and an impairing that veneration which is necessary 
to preserve their Duty to him; whereas a Prince who is so 
joined to his people that they seem to be his Limbs, rather than 
his Subjects, Cloathed with Mercy and Justice rightly apply'd
in their several places, his Throne supported by Love as well as 
by Power, and the warm wishes of his devoted Subjects, like 
never-failing Incense, still ascending towards him, looketh so 
like the best Image we can frame to our selves of God 
Almighty, that men would have much ado not to fall down and 
worship him, and would be much more tempted to the Sin of 
Idolatry, than to that of Disobedience. 

Our Trimmer is of Opinion, that there must be so much 
Dignity inseparably annexed to the Royal Function, as may be 
sufficient to secure it from insolence and contempt; and there 
must be Condescensions from the Throne, like kind showers 
from Heaven, that the Prince may look so much the more like 
God Almighty's Deputy upon Earth; for power without love 
hath a terrifying aspect, and the Worship which is paid to 
it is like that which the Indians give out of fear to Wild Beasts 
and Devils: he that feareth God only because there is an Hell, 
must wish there were no God; and he who feareth the King, 
only because he can punish, must wish there were no King; so 
that without a principle of Love, there can be no true Allegiance, 
and there must remain perpetual Seeds of Resistance against 
a power that is built upon such an unnatural Foundation, as 
that of fear and terrour. All force is a kind of foul-Play, and 
whosoever aimeth at it himself, doth by implication allow it to 
those he playeth with; so that there will be ever Matter 
prepared in the minds of People when they are provoked, and 
the Prince, to secure himself must live in the midst of his own 
Subjects, as if he were in a Conquer'd Country, raise Arms as 
if he were immediately to meet or resist an Invasion, and all 
this while sleep as unquietly from the fear of the Remedies, as 
he did before from that of the Disease; it being hard for him
