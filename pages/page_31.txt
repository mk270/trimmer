from those Clownish Methods the Fishermen had first intro- 
duc'd, and mended that Pattern so effectually, that a Man of 
that Age, if he should now come into the World, would not 
possibly know it. 

In Denmark the Reformation was entire; in some States of 
Germany, as well as Geneva, the Cure was universal; but in 
the rest of the World where the Protestant Religion took place, 
the Popish humour was too tough to be totally expell'd, and so 
it was in England, tho' the Change was made with all the 
advantage imaginable to the Reformation, it being Countenanced 
and introduced by Legal Authority, and by that means, might 
have been perhaps as perfect as in any other Place, if the short 
Reign of Edward the 6th, and the succession of a Popish Queen 
had not given such advantage to that Religion, that it hath 
subsisted ever since under all the hardships that have been put 
upon it; it hath been a strong Compact Body, and made the 
more so by these Sufferings; it was not strong enough to pre- 
vail, but it was able, with the help of foreign support, to carry 
on an Interest which gave the Crown trouble, and to make 
a considerable (not to say dangerous) Figure in the Nation; 
so much as this could not have been done without some hopes, 
nor these hopes kept up without some reasonable grounds: In 
Queen Elizabeth's time, the Spanish Zeal for their Religion, 
and the Revenge for 88, gave warmth to the Papists here, and 
above all the Right of the Queen of Scots to succeed, was while 
she lived sufficient to give them a better prospect of their 
Affairs: In King James's time their hopes were supported by 
the Treaty of the Spanish Match, and his gentleness towards 
them, which they were ready to interpret more in their own 
Favour, than was either reasonable or became them, so little 
tenderness they have, even where it is most due, if the Interest 
of their Religion cometh in competition with it. 

As for the late King, tho he gave the most glorious Evidence 
that ever Man did of his being a Protestant, yet, by the more 
than ordinary Influence the Queen was thought to have over 
him, and it so happening that the greatest part of his Anger 
was directed against the Puritans, there was such an advantage
