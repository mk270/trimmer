Queen's Title to part of Flanders, by Right of Devolution, he 
falleth into it with a mighty Force, for which the Spaniard was 
so little prepared, that he made a very swift Progress, and 
had such a Torrent of undisputed Victory, that England and 
Holland, tho the Wounds they had given one another were yet 
green, being struck with the apprehension of so near a danger 
to them, thought it necessary, for their own defence, to make 
up a sudden League, into which Sweden was taken to interpose

This had so good an effect, that France was stopt in its Career, 
and the Peace of Aix le Chapelle was a little after concluded. 
'Twas a forc'd put; and tho France wisely dissembled their

very small circumstances often are in relation to the Government 
of the World. About this time a general Humour, in opposition 
to France, had made us throw off their Fashion, and put on

and wisely considering that it is a natural Introduction first to 
make the World their Apes, that they may be afterwards their 
Slaves, it was thought that one of the Instructions Madam 
brought along with her, was to laugh us out of these Vests;
