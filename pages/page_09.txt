Men are generally too apt to be corrupted with, and for that 
Reason, a wise Prince, to prevent the temptation arising from 
common frailty, would choose to Govern by Rules for his own 
Sake, as well as for his Peoples, since it only secureth him from 
Errors, and doth not lessen the real Authority, that a good 
Magistrate would care to be possess'd of; for if the Will of a 
Prince is contrary either to Reason it self, or to the universal 
Opinion of his Subjects, the Law by a kind restraint rescueth 
him from a disease that would undo him; if his will on the 
other side is reasonable or well directed, that Will immediately 
becometh a Law, and he is arbitrary by an easie and natural 
Consequence, without taking pains, or overturning the World 
for it.

If Princes consider Laws as things impos'd on them, they 
have the appearance of Fetters of Iron, but to such as would 
make them their choice as well as their practice, they are 
Chains of Gold; and in that respect are Ornaments, as in 
others they are a defence to them; and by a Comparison, not 
improper for God's Vicegerents upon Earth, as our Maker 
never Commandeth our obedience to any thing, that as reason- 
able Creatures we ought not to make our own Election, so a 
good and wise Governour, tho' all Laws were abolish'd, would 
by the voluntary direction of his own Reason, do without 
restraint the very same things that they would have enjoyned. 

Our Trimmer thinketh that the King and Kingdom ought to 
be one Creature, not to be separated in their Political Capacity; 
and when either of them undertake to act a part, it is like the 
crawling of Worms after they are cut in pieces, which cannot be 
a lasting motion, the whole Creature not stirring at a time. 
If the Body have a dead Palsie, the Head cannot make it move; 
and God hath not yet delegated such a healing power to Princes, 
as that they can in a moment say to a Languishing People 
oppressed and in despair, Take up your Beds and walk. 

The Figure of a King, is so comprehensive and exalted a 
thing, that it is a kind of degrading him to lodge that power 
separately in his own Natural Person, which can never be safely 
or naturally great, but where the People are so united to him
