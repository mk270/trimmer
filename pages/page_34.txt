Tinctures and impressions might so far remain as, tho' they 
were very innocent in him, yet they might have ill effects here, 
by softning the Animosity which seemeth necessary to the 
Defender of the Protestant Faith, in opposition to such a 
powerful and irreconcilable an Enemy. 

You may be sure, that among all the sorts of Men who
