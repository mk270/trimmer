naturally trust Her, than the Studied Civilities of Strangers, 
let them be never so Hospitable; therefore 'tis not adviseable 
nor agreeing with the Rules of Governing Prudence, to provoke 
Men by hardships to forget that Nature, which else is sure to 
be of our side. 

When these Men by fair Usage are put again into their right 
Senses, they will have quite differing Reflections from those 
which Rigour and Persecution had raised in them: A Lay 
Papist will first consider his Abby-Lands, which notwithstand- 
ing whatever hath or can be alledged, must sink considerably in 
the Value, the moment that Popery prevails; and it being a 
disputable Matter, whether Zeal might not in a little time get 
the better of the Law in that case, a considering Man will 
admit that as an Argument to perswade him to be content with

Suspicion of his Country-men; he will reflect what an Incuni- 
brance it is to have his House a Pasture for hungry Priests to 
graze in, which have such a never-failing Influence upon the 
Foolish, which is the greatest part of every Man's Family, that 
a Man's Dominion, even over his own Children, is mangled, 
and divided, if not totally undermin'd by them; then to be 
subject to what Arbitrary Taxes the Popish Convocation shall 
impose upon him for the carrying on the Common Interest of 
that Religion, under Penalty of being mark'd out for half an 
Heretick by the rest of the Party; to have no share in Business, 
no opportunity of shewing his own Value to the World; to live
