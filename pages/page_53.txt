CONCLUSION 

To Conclude, our Trimmer is so fully satisfy'd of the Truth 
of those Principles by which he is directed in reference to 
the Publick, that he will neither be Bawled, Threatned, Laught, 
nor Drunk out of them; and instead of being converted by the 
Arguments of his Adversaries to their Opinions, he is very 
much confirmed in his own by them; he professeth solemnly 
that were it in his Power to chuse, he would rather have his 
Ambition bounded by the Commands of a Great and Wise 
Master, than let it range with a Popular Licence, tho; crown'd 
with success; yet he cannot commit such a Sin against the

besides the injustice of them, are (God be thanked) very 
unskilful too, for they fright the Birds, by talking so loud, 
from coming into the Nets that are laid for them; and when 
Men agree to rifle a House, they seldom give warning, or blow 
a Trumpet; but there are some small States-Men, who are so 
full charg'd with their own Expectations, that they cannot 
contain. And kind Heaven by sending such a seasonable Curse 
upon their undertakings, hath made their ignorance an Antidote 
against their Malice; some of these cannot treat peaceably; 
yielding will not satisfy them, they will have men by storm; 
there are others, that must have Plots, to make their Service 
more necessary, and have an Interest to keep them alive, since
