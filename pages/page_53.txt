CONCLU S IOhT.


'  O Conclude, oul' _r2mmer is so fully s_tisfy'd of the T_1'utI_
of those Principles by _hich he is directed in reference to
the Pu_Iic'h, that he will neither be Bawled, Threatned, La_ght,
nor Drunh out of them; and instead of being co__ve_'ted b_ the
Argun_ents of his Adversaries to their  Opinions, he is very
n_uch co_1_r___ed in his o_n by them;  he professeth soIemnly
th_t _ere it in his Po_er to chuse, he _w.,ouI_d rather have I_is
A?__bition bounded b_ the Commands of a_. Great and Wise
Maste_', than let _ it ra_nge__ wi.t_h a. Popular _L__icen_c_e t_h_ o' c_'o_n'd
__ith success;  yet he cannot commit such a Sin against the
glo?'ious thing call'd Libe?'ty, no1_' Iet his SouI stoop so m_ch
beIo_v it seIf, as to be content without repining to have his
_R__ e_a__s.o_ n__w.h___o_ Il_y_subdu:d., or the P_'ivilege of Acting lih_e a sensi 0 e

is t__e?'e ill this that is so Cri__inal, as to deserve the PenaIty of
that most singuIar A_ophthe61n, _ T1'i_nme_' żs worse tkan a
Re_eZ!  What do angry men ail to rail so _gainst Moderation;
_loth it not Iooh as if they _vel'e going to some very scurvy
E_t1'eme, that is  too  strong  to  be  digested  by  the  more
considering  pa1't  uf  Manhin_!  These  Arbitrary  Methods_,
besides the  inJ_u?__tic._e __o_f___the__m,  are (God be  thanhed)  very
u?1shilful _too, fo?' they fright the Birds, by taIki__g so Iuud,
fro__ co_ning into the Nets that are Iaid for the_1_; and when
Men ag?'ee to ri_e a House, they seIdon1 give _arlling, or bIow
a T__llm_et; but there _re some small States-Men, _ho are so
full ch_rg'd _ith  their o_n Expectations, tbat they cannot
contai?_.  And hind Heaven by sending such a season_ble Curse
upon their undertahings, hath n1ade their ignorance a?l Antidote
agai?_st their MaIice;  some of these cannot treat peaceabIy;
