The Authority of a KiIJg _vho is Hea. .d_o_f_t._!___e_____aw _s _ell as
the Dg' __t  o_ P__blich Justice, is debase_, _Then the clea_' stream
of the L_v is puddled and disturbed by Bunglers, o_' convey'd
I7y u__cIea__ Instrun_ents to the People.
Qu.r-___'__  a0  _T0uld _h,a_e them apgear in theil' full lust_'e,
and _Tould be grieved to see the day, wh√®n, instead of speahiI_g
_vith Autho_'ity f_'o_n the Se_ts of Justice, they should speah out
of a Grate, with _ la___e__ting voice lihe P_'isoI_ers that desire to
lJe _'escu'd.
He _visheth that the Bench may ha_e a Natural as _ell as a
Legal Superio_'ity to the Bar; he thinheth Mens c_bi!ities _ery

An uncontested Superiority in any Calling, _ill have  tl_e
better of any discountenance that Autho_'ity can put upon it,
al__ therefore if e__er such an unnatural Method should be int_'o-

A Judge hath such power lodg_ in him, that the King _Till

hind hath not befo_'e-hand recommended the Man to his Station;
_hen Men are made Judges of _hat they do not understand,
the World censul'eth such a Choice, not out of ill will to the
Me__, but fear to themseIves.
If the King had the sole _o_er o_ chusing Physicians, Men
_ould t_'enJble to see Bunglers prefe_'red, yet the necessity of
tahing Physich f_'om a Doctor, is generally not so great as that
of receiving Justice fron_ a Judge; and yet the Inferences will
be very _evere in such cases, for either it _ill be thought that
