and tho' the laziness of a slavish subjection, hath its Charms for 
the more gross and earthly part of Mankind, yet to men made 
of a better sort of Clay, all that the World can give without 
Liberty hath no taste; it is true, nothing is sold so cheap by 
unthinking men, but that doth no more lessen the real value of 
it, than a Country Fellows Ignorance doth that of a Diamond, 
in selling it for a Pot of Ale. Liberty is the Mistress of 
Mankind, she hath powerful Charms which do so dazzle us, that 
we find Beauties in her which perhaps are not there, as we do in 
other Mistresses; yet if she was not a Beauty, the World would 
not run mad for her; therefore since the reasonable desire of it 
ought not to be restrained, and that even the unreasonable 
desire of it cannot be entirely suppressed, those who would take 
it away from a People possessed of it, are likely to fail in the 
attempting, or be very unquiet in the keeping of it. 

Our Trimmer admireth our blessed Constitution, in which 
Dominion and Liberty are so well reconciled; it giveth to the 
Prince the glorious Power of commanding Freemen, and to 
the Subject, the satisfaction of seeing the Power so lodged, as 
that their Liberties are secure; it doth not allow the Crown 
such a Ruining Power, as that no grass can grow where e'er it 
treadeth, but a Cherishing and Protecting Power; such a one 
as hath a grim Aspect only to the offending Subjects, but is the 
joy and the Pride of all the good ones; their own interest being 
so bound up in it, as to engage them to defend and support it; 
and tho in some instances the King is restrained, yet nothing in 
the Government can move without him: our Laws make a 
distinction between Vassalage and Obedience; between a de- 
vouring Prerogative, and a licentious ungovernable Freedom: 
and as of all the Orders of Building, the Composite is the best, 
so ours by a happy mixture and a wise choice of what is best in 
others, is brought into a Form that is our Felicity who live 
under it, and the envy of our Neighbour that cannot imitate it. 

The Crown hath power sufficient to protect our Liberties. 
The People have so much Liberty as is necessary to make them 
useful to the Crown. 

Our Government is in a just proportion, no Tympany, no un-
