It is very hard fol' a PrinCe to feaT Rebe_ion, who neither
clot)_, nor inte__deth to do any thing to pro__ohe it ,. therefore too
ereat  a  diligence in the  Go__ernou_, to  r_ise and jn1p_'oye
_l_n__ers and fears _rom the Peuple, is __o ye_ good Sympto1__,
_nd naturaIly begetteth a__ in_erence th_t they have thoughts of
_utting tl_ei_' Sub.jects Allegiance to a T_al; and tbere_ore not
without some Reason fear beforehand, that the Irregulal'ities
they inte__d, m_y r_' ise M_en to a Resistance.

endeavour the suppressing &_ lci_d u_ Ri_ht which ma_emain
in the Body of the People, or to employ smal_ Authors in it,
_hose Omciousness or want of Money may encour_ge then_ to
write, tho' it is not very easie to have Abilities equal to such _'
SubJect; they forget that i_1 their tou high stl'ained A_'guments
for the Rights o_ Princcs, they very often plead against hun_ane
Nature, which will a_vay_ give a Biass to those Reasons which
seem o_ he1' side; it is the People that Readeth those Books,
and it is the People that _nu_t _udge of them; and thel'efore no
Ma_ims should be laid dow'1_ for the Right of Governlnent, to
_vhich there can be any Rea_onable ObJection_' fur the Wol'ld
hath an Interest, and for that Reason is more than ordina_'y
disce_'ning to _nd out the _veah si_es of such Argun_ents as al'e
intended to do t_em hurt; and it is a dinlin_tion to a Government,
to P_'o__ote or Co__ntena__ce such we_ aï¬€ected mistahes which
_re  turned  upon  it with  disad__antage  wheI_ever  they  i_re

Example, to Clai ___ that which the,_ have not.
In Power, as in most othe_' things, the way fol' Princes to
heegi_t is not to grasp more than theil' Arms ca_n weIl _h___ld;
the nice and unnecessary enquiring into these things, or the
LiCensing some Boohs, and _u_pressing some others _vitho_1t
s_Cient Reason to Justi_e tlle doing either, is so far fl'om
being an Adv&nt_ge to a Govel'nmeT1t, th4t it exposeth it to the
Censure
