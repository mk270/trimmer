precautions to secure himself in all Events, yet he is uncapable 
of entertaining vain and remote suspicions of those, of whom he 
resolveth never to deserve ill. 

It is very hard for a Prince to fear Rebellion, who neither 
doth, nor intendeth to do any thing to provoke it; therefore too 
great a diligence in the Governours, to raise and improve 
dangers and fears from the People, is no very good Symptom, 
and naturally begetteth an inference that they have thoughts of 
putting their Subjects Allegiance to a Tryal; and therefore not 
without some Reason fear beforehand, that the Irregularities 
they intend, may raise Men to a Resistance. 

Our Trimmer thinketh it no advantage to a Government, to 
endeavour the suppressing all kind of Right which may remain 
in the Body of the People, or to employ small Authors in it, 
whose Officiousness or want of Money may encourage them to 
write, tho' it is not very easie to have Abilities equal to such a 
Subject; they forget that in their too high strained Arguments 
for the Rights of Princes, they very often plead against humane 
Nature, which will always give a Biass to those Reasons which 
seem of her side; it is the People that Readeth those Books, 
and it is the People that must judge of them; and therefore no 
Maxims should be laid down for the Right of Government, to 
which there can be any Reasonable Objection; for the World 
hath an Interest, and for that Reason is more than ordinary 
discerning to find out the weak sides of such Arguments as are 
intended to do them hurt; and it is a diminution to a Government, 
to Promote or Countenance such well affected mistakes which 
are turned upon it with disadvantage whenever they are 
detected and expose'd; and Naturally the too earnest Endeavours 
to take from Men the Right they have, tempt them, by the 
Example, to Claim that which they have not. 

In Power, as in most other things, the way for Princes to 
keep it, is not to grasp more than their Arms can well hold; 
the nice and unnecessary enquiring into these things, or the 
Licensing some Books, and suppressing some others without 
sufficient Reason to Justifie the doing either, is so far from 
being an Advantage to a Government, that it exposeth it to the
