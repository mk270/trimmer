Interest of his own had sacrificed that of the Nation, by joining 
with the stronger side, to suppress the Power of Spain, which 
he ought to have supported. Such a Method was natural 
enough to an Usurper, and shew'd he was not the Lawful Father 
of the People, by his having so little care of them; and the 
Example coming from that hand, one would think should, for 
that Reason, be less likely to be followed. But to go on, home 
cometh the King, followed with Courtships from all Nations 
abroad, of which some did it not only to make them forget how 
familiarly they had us'd him when he was in other Circumstances, 
but to bespeak the Friendship of a Prince, who besides his other 
Greatness, was yet more considerable by being re-established by 
the love of his people. France had an Interest either to dispose 
us to so much good will, or at least to put us into such a Con- 
dition, that we might give no Opposition to their Designs; and 
Flanders being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a lasting Beauty 
for which they have an incurable passion, and not being kind 
enough to consent to them, they meditated to commit a Rape 
upon her, which they thought would not be easie to do, while 
England and Holland were agreed to rescue her, when-ever they

matter on both sides, in a little time it took Fire, which gave 
those that kindled it, sufficient cause to smile and hug them- 
selves, to see us both fall into the Net they had laid for us. And 
it is observable and of good example to us, if we will take it, 
That their Design being to set us together at Cuffs to weaken 
us, they kept themselves Lookers-on till our Victories began to 
break the Balance; then the King of France, like a wise Prince, 
was resolved to support the beaten side, and would no more let 
the Power of the Sea, than we ought to suffer the Monarchy of 
Europe, to fall into one hand: In pursuance to this, he took 
part with the Dutch, and in a little time made himself Umpire 
of the Peace between us; some time after, upon pretence of his
