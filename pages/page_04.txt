Romans, who took Patterns of good Laws, even from those they
had subdued; and at the same time that they Triumph'd over
an enslav'd People, the very Laws of that place did not only
remain safe, but became Victorious; their new Masters, instead
of suppressing them, paid them more respect that they had
from those rho first made them: and by this wise method they
arrived to such an admirable Constitution of Laws, that to this
day they Reign by them; this Excellency of them Triumpheth
still, and the World payeth now an acknowledgment of their
obedience to that Mighty Empire, though so many Ages after
it is dissolved; and by a later instance, the Kings of France
who in practice use their Laws pretty familiarly, yet think their
Picture  is drawn with most advantage upon their Seals, when
they are placed in the Seat of Justice; and tho' the Hierogly-
phick is not there of so much use to the People as they would
wish, yet it sheweth that no Prince is so Great, as not to think
fit, for his own Credit at least, to give an outward, when he refuseth
a real worship to the Laws.

They are to mankind that which the Sun is to Plants, whilst
it cherisheth and preserveth them.  Where they have their force
and  are  not clouded or  supprest, every thing smileth and
flourisheth; but where they are darkened, and not suffered to
shine out, it maketh every thing to wither and decay.

They secure Men not only against one another, but against
themselves too; they are a Sanctuary to which the Crown hath
occasion to resort as often as the People. so that it is an interest
as well as a Duty to preserve them.

There would be no end of making a Panegyrick of Laws; let
it be enough to add, that without Laws the World would be-
come a Wilderness, and Men little less than Beasts; but with
all this, the best things may come to be the worst, if they are
not in good hands;  and if it be true that the wisest Men
generally make the Laws, it is as true, that the strongest do
often Interpret them: and as Rivers belong as  much to the
Channel where they run, as to the Spring from whence they
first rise, so the Laws depend as much upon the Pipes thro'
which the are to pass, as upon the Fountain from whence
they flow.
