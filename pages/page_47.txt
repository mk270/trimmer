to anotl_er, and being _ed, _ec_meth still the more hung _y; so
that fo_' the Con_ederates to ex_ect a_  secu1'ity fr_o.m a.n..Jr thing
but thei1' o_Tn united strength_, is a 1nost _niser_ble fallacy; and
if they cannot resist the IncroackJnents of France b_ thei_' Arms,
it is in _ain for then_ to dream of any other meaI_s of preserva-
tion; it _Tould have the better grace, besid_s the savjng so much
Blood and Ruin, to give up all _t once; mahe _ P_'esent of
the___selves, to appease this haughty Mo__arch, Tather than be
_Thispe_d, Aatter'd, or co2ened out of their liberty.  Nothing is
so so_t as the _rst applications of a greater Prince, to engage
_ weahe_', but that smiling Countenance is but a _i2ard, it is
not the true Face; for as soon as their turn is ser_d, the Cou_-
ship Aies to some othe_' Prince or State, where the same part
is to be acted over again;  leaveth the old n_istalcen Friend to
Neglect and Contempt, and lihe an insolent Lover to a Cast oﬀ
Mistress, Reproaches he_' with that Infamy, of __hich he him-

_Tl1ilst the_ can  be usefuI.  The various Methods and deep
Intrigues, _vith t_e diﬀe__ing Notes i_ several Countries, do _ot

Practice, by ___hich universal Monarchy __ay be obtain'd.  Who
can reconcile the _ithdr_Ting of I_is Troops _rom L__e_6_r9, in
cunsideration of theWa_' inH_ngar_,_hich __asnotthen decl_red,
and presently _fter encouraging the _rn to tahe _enna, and
coI_sequently to destroy the Em_ire!  Or who can think t__t
the  Persecution  of the Poor Protestants of France, will be
accepted of God, as an Atonement for ha_arding the loss of
the _Thole Christian Faith !  Can he be thoug_t in earnest, whe__
he seem'd to be afraid of the Spanżar_s, and for that reason
must have ___en6_r9, and that he cannot be safe from Ger_any,
unless he is in  possession  of Stras6_rg!  All  In_ustice and
Violence must in it self be grievous, but the agg1'avations of
supporting 'em by false Argument_, and insulting Re_sons, has
something in it v, et _ore provohing th_n the Injuries them-
