to another, and being fed, becometh still the more hungry; so 
that for the Confederates to expect a security from any thing 
but their own united strength, is a most miserable fallacy; and 
if they cannot resist the Incroachments of France by their Arms, 
it is in vain for them to dream of any other means of preserva- 
tion; it would have the better grace, besides the saving so much 
Blood and Ruin, to give up all at once; make a Present of 
themselves, to appease this haughty Monarch, rather than be 
whisper'd, flattered, or cozened out of their liberty. Nothing is 
so soft as the first applications of a greater Prince, to engage 
a weaker, but that smiling Countenance is but a Vizard, it is 
not the true Face; for as soon as their turn is served, the Court- 
ship flies to some other Prince or State, where the same part 
is to be acted over again; leaveth the old mistaken Friend to 
Neglect and Contempt, and like an insolent Lover to a Cast off 
Mistress, Reproaches her with that Infamy, of which he him- 
self was the Author. Sweden, Bavaria, Palatine, $c. may by 
their Fresh Examples, teach other Princes what they are 
reasonably to expect, and what Snakes are hid under the 
Flowers the Court of France so liberally throweth upon them 
whilst they can be useful. The various Methods and deep 
Intrigues, with the differing Notes in several Countries, do not 
only give suspicion, but assurance that every thing is put in 
Practice, by which universal Monarchy may be obtain'd. Who 
can reconcile the withdrawing of his Troops from Luxenburg, in 
consideration of the War in Hungary, which was not then declared, 
and presently after encouraging the Turk to take Vienna, and 
consequently to destroy the Empire? Or who can think that 
the Persecution of the Poor Protestants of France, will be 
accepted of God, as an Atonement for hazarding the loss of 
the whole Christian Faith? Can he be thought in earnest, when 
he seem'd to be afraid of the Spaniards, and for that reason 
must have Luxenburg, and that he cannot be safe from Germany, 
unless he is in possession of Strasburg? All Injustice and 
Violence must in it self be grievous, but the aggravations of 
supporting 'em by false Arguments, and insulting Reasons, has 
something in it yet more provoking than the Injuries them-
