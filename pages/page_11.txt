to forget, that more Princes have been destroyed by their Guards 
than by their People; and that even at the time when the Rule 
was Quod Principi placuit Lex esto, the Armies and Praetorian 
Bands which were the Instruments of that unruly Power, were 
frequently the means made use of to destroy them who had it. 
There will ever be this difference between God and his Vice- 
gerents, that God is still above the Instruments he useth, and 
out of the danger of receiving hurt from them; but Princes 
can never lodge Power in any hands, which may not at some 
time turn it back upon them; for tho' it is possible enough for 
a King to have power to satisfy his Ambition; yet no Kingdom 
hath Money enough to satisfie the avarice of under-Work- 
men, who learn from that Prince who will exact more than 
belongeth to him, to expect from him much more than they 
deserve, and growing angry upon the first disappointment, 
they are the Devils which grow terrible to the Conjurers 
themselves who brought them up, and can't send them down 
again. And besides that there can be no lasting Radical 
Security, but where the Governed are satisfied with the 
Governours, it must be a Dominion very unpleasant to a Prince 
of an elevated Mind, to impose an abject and sordid servility, 
instead of receiving the willing Sacrifice of Duty and Obedience. 
The bravest Princes in all times, who were uncapable of any 
other kind of fear, have fear'd to grieve their own People; such 
a fear is a glory, and in this sense 'tis an infamy not to be 
a Coward: So that the mistaken Heroes who are void of this 
generous kind of fear, need no other aggravation to compleat 
their ill Characters. 

When a Despotick Prince hath bruised all his Subjects with a 
slavish Obedience, all the force he can use cannot subdue his 
own fears; Enemies of his own Creation, to which he can never 
be reconciled, it being impossible to do injustice and not to fear 
Revenge: there is no cure for this fear, but the not deserving to 
be hurt, and therefore a Prince who doth not allow his thoughts 
to stray beyond the Rules of Justice, hath always the blessing 
of an inward quiet and assurance, as a natural effect of his 
good Meaning to his People, and tho he will not neglect due
