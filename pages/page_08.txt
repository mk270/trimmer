 
the Scruples and Apprehensions to which Men are naturally 
inclin'd, in relation to those that govern them; such a 
Magistrate is the Life and Soul of Justice, whereas the Law 
is but a Body and a dead one too, without his Influence to give 
it warmth and vigour, and by the irresistible Power of his 
Vertue, he doth so reconcile Dominion and Allegiance, that all 
disputes between them are silenced and subdued, and indeed 
no Monarchy can be Perfect and Absolute without exception, 
but where the Prince is Superior by his Vertue, as well as by his 
Character and his Power; so that to screw out Precedents of 
unlimited Power, is a plain diminution to a Prince that Nature 
hath made Great, and who had better make himself a glorious 
Example to Posterity, than borrow an Authority from Dark 
Records, raised out of the Grave, which besides their Non-usage,

have their equal turns in the Government of the World, and 
besides, that the Will of Man is so various, and so unbounded 
a thing, and so fatal too when joined with Power misapply'd; 
it is no wonder if those who are to be govern'd, are unwilling 
to have so dangerous as well as so uncertain a Standard of 
their Obedience. 

There must be therefore Rules and Laws: for want of which, 
or at least the Observation of them, it was as Capital for a 
Man to say that Nero did not play well upon the Lute, as to 
commit Treason, or Blaspheme the Gods. And even Vespasian 
himself had like to have lost his Life, for sleeping whilst he 
should have attended and admir'd that Emperours Impertinence
