promote Mens Devotions: On the other side, there may be 
too great Restraint put upon Men, whom God and Nature 
hath distinguished from their Fellow Labourers, by blessing 
them with a happier Talent, and, by giving them not only good 
Sense, but a powerful Utterance too, hath enabled them to gush 
out upon the attentive Auditory, with a mighty stream of 
Devout and unaffected Eloquence; when a Man so qualified,

and by such a Submission to Authority, as becometh them, 
if they cannot acquiesce in what is imposed, let them deserve 
a Legislative Remedy to their Sufferings, there being no other 
way to give them perfect redress; and either to seek it, or 
pretend to give it by any other Method, would not only be 
vain, but Criminal too in those that go about it; yet with all 
this, there may in the mean time be a prudential Latitude left, 
as to the manner of prosecuting the Laws now in force against 
them: The Government is in some degree answerable for 
such an Administration of them, as may be free from the 
Censure of Impartial Judges; and in order to that, it would 
be necessary that one of these methods be pursued, either to 
let loose the Laws to their utmost extent, without any Modera- 
tion or Restraint, in which at least the Equality of the Govern-
