at the best an useless, and by others to be thought a dangerous 
Member of the Nation where he is born, is a burthen to a 
generous Mind that cannot be taken off by all the Pleasure of a 
lazy unmanly life, or by the nauseous enjoyment of a dull Plenty, 
that produceth no food for the Mind, which will be considered 
in the first place by a Man that hath a Soul; when he shall 
think, that if his Religion, after his wading through a Sea of 
Blood, come at last to prevail, it would infinitely lessen, if 
not entirely destroy the Glory, Riches, Strength and Liberty 
of his own Country, and what a Sacrifice is this to make to 
Rome, where they are wise enough to wonder there should be 
such Fools in the World, as to venture, struggle, and contend, 
nay even die Martyrs for that which, should it succeed, would 
prove a Judgment instead of a Blessing to them; he will con-

pains to see if he can unmuffle himself from the Mask of 
Infallibility, will think it reasonable to set his Imprison'd Senses 
at Liberty, and that he hath a right to see with his own Eyes, 
hear with his own Ears, and judge by his own Reason; the 
consequence of which might probably be, that weighing things 
in a right Scale, and seeing them in their true Colours, he 
would distinguish between the merit of suffering for a good 
Cause, and the foolish ostentation of drawing inconveniences 
upon himself; and therefore will not be unwilling to be convinced 
that our Protestant Creed may make him happy in the other 
World, and the easier in this. A few of such wise Proselytes 
would by their Example draw so many after them, that the 
Party would insensibly melt away, and in a little time, without
