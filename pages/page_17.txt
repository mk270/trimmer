imaginary Lawrels; let us Represent him gazing among his 
Flatterers, and receiving their false Worship, like a Child never 
Contradicted, and therefore always Cozen'd: or like a Lady 
complemented only to be abused, condemned never to hear Truth, 
and Consequently never to do Justice, wallowing in the soft Bed 
of wanton and unbridled Greatness, not less odious to the 
Instruments themselves, than to the Objects of his Tyranny; 
blown up into an Ambitious Dropsy, never to be satisfied by the 
Conquest of other People, or by the Oppression of his own; 
by aiming to be more than a Man, he falleth lower than the 
meanest of 'em, a mistaken Creature, swelled with Panegyricks, 
and flattered out of his Senses, and not only an Incumbrance, 
but a Nuisance to Mankind, a hardened and unrelenting Soul, 
and like some Creatures that grow fat with Poisons, he groweth 
great by other Mens Miseries; an Ambitious Ape of the Divine 
Greatness, an unruly Gyant that would storm even Heaven it 
self, but that his scaling Ladders are not long enough; in short, 
a Wild and devouring Creature in rich Trappings, and with all 
his Pride, no more than a Whip in God Almighty's hand, to be 
thrown into the Fire when the World hath been sufficiently 
scourged with it: This Picture laid in right Colours would not 
incite Men to wish for such a Government, but rather to acknow- 
ledge the happiness of our own, under which we enjoy all the 
Privilege Reasonable Men can desire, and avoid all the Miseries 
many others are subject to; so that our Trimmer would keep 
it with all its faults, and doth as little forgive those who give the 
occasion of breaking it, as he doth those that take it.

Our Trimmer is a Friend to Parliaments, notwithstanding all 
their faults, and excesses, which of late have given such matter 
of Objection to them; he thinketh that tho' they may at some 
times be troublesome to Authority, yet they add the greatest 
strength to it under a wise Administration; he believeth no 
Government is perfect except a kind of Omnipotence reside in 
it, to exercise upon great Occasions: Now this cannot be 
obtained by force alone upon People, let it be never so great, there 
must be their consent too, or else a Nation moveth only by 
being driven, a sluggish and constrained Motion, void of that
