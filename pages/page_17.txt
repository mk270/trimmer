imaginary Lawrels;  let us _epresent him gazing among his
Flatterers, and receiTing their false Wo_'ship, lilce a Child never
Co__tradicted, and therefore al_ays Cozen'd: o_' lihe a _ady
complemented only to be abused, conde_nned never to hear T_'uth,
_nd Consequently never to do J_1stice, _Tallo_ing in the soft Bed
of _Tanton and unbridled  G1'eatness, nut less odious to the
Instruments tI1emselves, than to the Ob_ects of his Tyranny;
hlo_ up into an Ambitious Dro_sy, never to be satis_ed by the
Conquest of other People, or by the O_pression of his o_Tn;
by aiming to be more than a M_n, he falleth lo_Ter than the
meanest of ém, a mistahen Creatu_'_, s_elled _ith Pane_richs,
an_ Aatte_'e_ out of his Senses, and not only an Inc_1mbrance,
but a Nuisance to Manhind, a ha_'dened and unrelenting Soul,
and lihe some Creatures that gro_ fat with Poisons, be gro_eth
g_'eat by other Mens Mise_'ies; an Ambitious Ape of the _ivine
G_'eatness, an unruly Gyant that would storm even Heaven it
self, but that his scaling Ladders are not Iong enough; in short,
a Wild and devouring Creature in _'ich T_'_p_ings, _nd with _ll
his Pride, no more than a Whip in God _might_s hand, to be
thro_n into the Fire _hen the Wo1'ld hath been sumcientl_
scourged __ith it: This Picture laid in right Colours _vo_1ld not
incite Men tu _ish for such a Government, but _'ather to achno_T-
led__e the happiness of our o_n, under which we en_oy all the
Privilege Reason_ble Men can desire, and avoid all the Miseries
many others are sub_ect to; so that our Tr21nmer _ould heep
g, , it _vith all its faults, and doth as little forgiTe those who giTe the
occasion of breahing it, as he doth those th_t tahe it.
Our Trżn21ner is a Friend to Parlia_ents, not_ithsta__ding all
their faults, and e,_cesses, which of late have eiven such matter
of Ob_ection to them; he thinheth that tho' they may at some
times be troublesome to Authority, yet they add the greatest
strength to it under a _vise Ad_ninistr_tion; he believeth no
Go__ernment is pe_ect except a hind of Omnipotence r_es_id_e__i_
it, to e_ercise upon  great  Occasions:  Now this cannot be
obtaine_ by force alone upon People,, let it be never so great, there
_ust be their consent too, or eIse a Nation moveth onl)_ by
being driven, a sIuggish and constrained Motion, void of that
