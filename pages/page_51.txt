us, misplace our active rage one against another, whilst we are 
turn'd into Statues on that side where lieth our greatest danger; 
to be unconcern' d not only at our Neighbours ruine but our 
own, and let our Island lie like a great Hulk in the Sea, without 
Rudder or Sail, all the Men cast away in her, or as if we were all 
Children in a great Cradle, and rockt asleep to a foreign Tune. 

I say when our Trimmer representeth to his Mind, our 
Roses blasted and discolour'd, whilst the Lilies Triumph and 
grow Insolent upon the Comparison; when he considereth our 
own once flourishing Lawrel, now withered and dying, and 
nothing left us but a remembrance of a better part in History 
than we shall make in the next Age, which will be no more to 
us than an Escutcheon hung upon our Door when we are dead; 
when he foreseeth from hence growing Infamy from abroad, 
confusion at home, and all this without the possibility of a Cure, 
in respect of the voluntary fetters good Men put upon 
themselves by their Allegiance; without a good measure of 
preventing Grace, he would be tempted to go out of the World 
like a Roman Philosopher, rather than endure the burthen of 
Life under such a discouraging Prospect. But Mistakes, as all 
other things, have their Periods, and many times the nearest way 
to Cure, is not to oppose them, but stay till they are crusht with 
their own weight: for Nature will not allow any thing to 
continue long that is violent; violence is a wound, and as a 
wound must be curable in a little time, or else; tis Mortal, but 
a Nation comes near to be Immortal, therefore the wound will 
one time or another be cured, tho perhaps by such rough 
Methods, if too long forborn, as may even make the best 
Remedies we can prepare, to be at the same time a Melancholy 
Contemplation to us; there is but one thing (God Almighties 
Providence excepted) to support a Man from sinking under 
these afflicting thoughts, and that is the hopes we draw singly 
from the King himself, without the mixture of any other 
consideration. 

Tho the Nation was lavish of their Kindness to him at his first 
coming, yet there remaineth still a stock of Warmth in Mens 
Hearts for him. Besides, the good Influences of his happy
