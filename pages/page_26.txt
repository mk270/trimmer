So it looketh like want of health in a Church, when instead of 
depending upon the power of that Truth which it holdeth, and 
the good Examples of them that teach it, to support it self, and 
to suppress Errors, it should have a perpetual recourse to the 
secular Authority, and even upon the slightest occasions. 

Our Trimmer hath his Objections to the too busy diligence, 
and to the overdoing of some of the dissenting Clergy, and he 
doth as little approve of those of our Church, who wear God 
Almighty's Liveries, as some old Warders in the Tower do the 
King's, who do nothing in their place but receive their Wages 
for it; he thinketh that the Liberty of the late times gave men 
so much Light, and diffused it so universally amongst the 
people, that they are not now to be dealt with, as they might 
have been in Ages of less enquiry; and therefore tho in some 
well chosen and dearly beloved Auditories, good resolute Non-

are become so good Judges of what they hear, that the Clergy 
ought to be very wary how they go about to impose upon their 
Understandings, which are grown less humble than they were 
in former times, when the Men in black had made Learning such 
a sin in the Laity, that for fear of offending, they made a Con- 
science of being able to read; but now the World is grown 
sawcy, and expecteth Reasons, and good ones too, before they 
give up their own Opinions to other Mens Dictates, tho never 
so Magisterially delivered to them. 

Our Trimmer is far from approving the Hypocrisie, which 
seemeth to be the reigning Vice amongst some of the Dissenting 
Clergy, he thinketh it the most provoking sin Men can be 
guilty of, in Relation to Heaven, and yet (which may seem 
strange) that very sin which shall destroy the Soul of the Man 
who preacheth, may help to save those of the Company that 
hear him, and even those who are cheated by the false Ostenta- 
tion of his strictness of life, may by that Pattern be encouraged 
to the real Practice of those Christian Vertues which he doth 
so deceitfully profess; so that the detestation of this fault may 
possibly be carry'd on too far by our own Orthodox Divines, if 
they think it cannot be enough expressed without bending the
