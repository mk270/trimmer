for Ini_ab.l.e___A_ _d_c_;  D___t _ .MJus_t_i_c_e _Re_l_.i__o_n__ nay,  even
Humane  P_'udence too, biddeth the People  suﬀer any_ th..in. g
_'áther tha_n__r_e_?_is_t_; b_t unco_l're_c_t_ed Nature,wh. e._'_e___e__r.e it f..eels
th_e sn_art _vill run to the neares,t Re__1edy.  Mens P_ssions in
this Case are to be consider'd as _ell as their Duty, let it be
never so stro__gIy enforc'd, for if their Passions a_'e pro_ok'd,
they being as n_uch a part of lls as our Limbs, they lead Men
!_into a short way of Arguing, that ad_nitteth no distinction,
_;and  from  the  fo__ndation  of  Self-Defence  tI_ey  will  dr_v
!Inferences that _vjll have nliserable eﬀects u on the  uiet of a
. Government.
_T Our Trj112_er thel'efore d_'eads a generwl discontent, because
; he thinheth it diﬀereth from a RebelIion, onIy as a S_otte_
_eve_' doth fTo_n the Plague, the same Species under a lowe_'
degree of Malignity; it _vorheth seveTal _Tays; so__etimes like
a _lo_ Poyson that h_th its Eﬀects at a great distance from the
time it _Tas gi_'en, sometimes li_e _ry Flax p_'ep_red to catch at
the _1'st Fire, ol_ like Seed in the g_'o_nd ready to sp_'out upon
the _rst Sho_er;  in every sha_e 'tiws _famt__anl, and ou_' Trj1nJner
thinketh no p_ins or precaution can be so great _s t_ogr_e e  '.
In short b_ thin_eth himself in the right, grounding his
Opi__ion upon that T_'uth, _Thich equally hateth to be under the
Oppressions of _Trangling Sophistry of the one hand, or the
short dictates of mistahen Authority on the other.
Our Tr2_e1ner adoreth the Goddess Truth, tho' in all Ages she
. _h_th been scurvily used, as we_ as those that Worshippe_ he_';
ti_ of l_' te become such a ruining Vi_'tue, that Mankind seemeth
to be agreed to co _nmend and avoid it; yet the want of PTactice
which Nepealeth the othe_' Laws, hath no inAuence upon the
La_T of Truth, because it I_ath root in Heaven, and an Tntri__lsich
_alue in it self, that can never be imp_ired; she sheweth her
Great__ess  in  this, that  her  Enemies even _hen  they  are
successful are asham'd to own it ; nothing but powerful Truth
hath the prerogative of Triumphing, not only after _ictories,
b_t in spite  of them, and  to put Conquest her self out of
Countenance;  she may be hept under and _upprest, but her
_ignity still remaineth with her, even when she is in Chains;
Falshood
