formidable Adversary; Duty, Justice, Religion, nay, even 
Humane Prudence too, biddeth the People suffer any thing 
rather than resist; but unconnected Nature, where e're it feels 
the smart will run to the nearest Remedy. Mens Passions in 
this Case are to be considered as well as their Duty, let it be 
never so strongly enforced, for if their Passions are provoked, 
they being as much a part of us as our Limbs, they lead Men 
into a short way of Arguing, that admitteth no distinction, 
and from the foundation of Self-Defence they will draw 
Inferences that will have miserable effects upon the quiet of a 
Government. 

Our Trimmer therefore dreads a general discontent, because 
he thinketh it differeth from a Rebellion, only as a Spotted 
Fever doth from the Plague, the same Species under a lower 
degree of Malignity; it worketh several ways; sometimes like 
a slow Poyson that hath its Effects at a great distance from the 
time it was given, sometimes like dry Flax prepared to catch at 
the first Fire, or like Seed in the ground ready to sprout upon 
the first Shower; in every shape 'tis fatal, and our Trimmer 
thinketh no pains or precaution can be so great as to prevent it. 

In short he thinketh himself in the right, grounding his 
Opinion upon that Truth, which equally hateth to be under the 
Oppressions of wrangling Sophistry of the one hand, or the 
short dictates of mistaken Authority on the other. 

Our Trimmer adoreth the Goddess Truth, tho' in all Ages she 
hath been scurvily used, as well as those that Worshipped her; 
'tis of late become such a ruining Virtue, that Mankind seemeth 
to be agreed to commend and avoid it; yet the want of Practice 
which Repealeth the other Laws, hath no influence upon the 
Law of Truth, because it hath root in Heaven, and an Intrinsick 
value in it self, that can never be impaired; she sheweth her 
Greatness in this, that her Enemies even when they are 
successful are asham'd to own it; nothing but powerful Truth 
hath the prerogative of Triumphing, not only after Victories, 
but in spite of them, and to put Conquest her self out of 
Countenance; she may be kept under and supprest, but her 
Dignity still remaineth with her, even when she is in Chains;
