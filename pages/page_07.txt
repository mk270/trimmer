We think that a wise Mean, between these barbarous 
Extreams, is that which self-Preservation ought to dictate to 
our Wishes; and we may say we have attained to this Mean 
in a greater measure, than any Nation now in being, or perhaps 
any we have read of, tho never so much Celebrated for the 
Wisdom or Felicity of their Constitutions: We take from one 
the too great power of doing hurt, and yet leave enough to 
govern and protect us; we take from the other, the Confusion, 
the Parity, the Animosities, and the License, and yet reserve 
a due care of such a Liberty, as may consist with Mens 
Allegiance; but it being hard, if not impossible, to be exactly 
even, our Government hath much the stronger Biass towards 
Monarchy, which by the general Consent and Practise of 
Mankind, seemeth to have the Advantage in dispute against a 
Common-wealth; The Rules of a Common-wealth are too hard 
for the Bulk of Mankind to come up to; that Form of Govern- 
ment requireth such a spirit to carry it on, as doth not dwell in 
great Numbers, but is restrained to so very few, especially in 
this Age, that let the Methods appear never so reasonable in 
Paper, they must fail in Practice, which will ever be suited 
more to Mens Nature as it is, than as it should be.


Monarchy is lik'd by the People, for the Bells and the Tinsel, 
the outward Pomp and Gilding, and there must be milk for 
Babes, since the greatest part of Mankind are, and ever will be 
included in that List; and it is approved by wise and thinking 
Men, (all Circumstances and Objections impartially considered) 
that it hath so great an advantage above all other Forms, when 
the Administration of that Power falleth in good hands, that 
all other Governments look out of Countenance, when they are 
set in Competition with it. Lycurgus might have sav'd himself 
the trouble of making Laws, if either he had been Immortal, 
or that he could have secur'd to Posterity, a succeeding Race of 
Princes like himself; his own Example was a better Law, than 
he could with all his skill tell how to make; such a Prince is a 
Living Law, that dictateth to his Subjects, whose thoughts in 
that case never rise above their Obedience, the Confidence they 
have in the Vertue and Knowledge of the master, preventing
