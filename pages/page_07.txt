We think that a wise Mean, between these barbarous 
Extreams, is that which self-Preservation ought to dictate to 
our Wishes; and we may say we have attained to this Mean 
in a greater measure, than any Nation now in being, or perhaps 
any we have read of, tho never so much Celebrated for the 
Wisdom or Felicity of their Constitutions: We take from one 
the too great power of doing hurt, and yet leave enough to 
govern and protect us; we take from the other, the Confusion, 
the Parity, the Animosities, and the License, and yet reserve 
a due care of such a Liberty, as may consist with Mens 
Allegiance; but it being hard, if not impossible, to be exactly 
even, our Government hath much the stronger Biass towards 
Monarchy, which by the general Consent and Practise of 
Mankind, seemeth to have the Advantage in dispute against a 
Common-wealth; The Rules of a Common-wealth are too hard 
for the Bulk of Mankind to come up to; that Form of Govern- 
ment requireth such a spirit to carry it on, as doth not dwell in 
great Numbers, but is restrained to so very few, especially in 
this Age, that let the Methods appear never so reasonable in 
Paper, they must fail in Practice, which will ever be suited 
more to Mens Nature as it is, than as it should be.
