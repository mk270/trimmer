any angry word, we should come to an Union that all Good 
Men would have Reason to rejoyce at; but we are not to pre- 
sume upon these Conversions, without preparing Men for them 
by kind and reconciling Arguments; nothing is so against our 
Nature, as to believe those can be in the right who are too hard 
upon us; there is a deformity in every thing that doth us hurt, 
it will look scurvily in our Eye while the smart continueth, and 
a Man must have an extraordinary Measure of Grace, to think 
well of a Religion that reduceth him and his Family to Misery; 
in this respect our Trimmer would consent to the mitigation 
of such Laws as were made (as it is said King Henry VIII. got 
Queen Elizabeth) in a heat against Rome: It may be said that 
even States as well as private Men are subject to Passion; a just 
indignation of a villainous Attempt produceth at the same time 
such Remedies, as perhaps are not without some mixture of 
Revenge, and therefore tho time cannot Repeal a Law, it may 
by a Natural Effect soften the Execution of it; there is less 
danger to Rouse a Lyon when at Rest, than to awake Laws that 
were intended to have their times of Sleeping, nay more than 
that, in some Cases their Natural periods of Life, dying of them- 
selves without the Solemnity of being revoked any otherwise 
than by the common consent of Mankind, who do cease to 
Execute when the Reasons in great Measure fail that first 
Created and Justify'd the Rigour of such unusual Penalties. 

Our Trimmer is not eager to pick out some places in His- 
tory against this or any other Party; quite contrary, is very 
sollicitous to find out any thing that may be healing, and tend 
to an Agreement; but to prescribe the means of this Gentleness 
so as to make it effectual, must come from the only place that 
can furnish Remedies for this Cure, viz. a Parliament; in the 
mean time, it is to be wished there may be such a mutual calm- 
ness of Mind, as that the Protestants might not be so jealous, 
as still to smell the Match that was to blow up the King and 
both Houses in the Gunpowder Treason, or to start at every 
appearance of Popery, as if it were just taking Possession. On 
the other side, let not the Papists suffer themselves to be led 
by any hopes, tho never so flattering, to a Confidence or Osten-
