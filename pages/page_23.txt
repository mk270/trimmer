Government, to wish for more Prerogative Declarations in 
favour of scrupulous Men, or to dispence with Penal Laws in 
such manner, or to such an end, that suspecting Men might 
with some reason pretend, that so hated a thing as Persecution 
could never make way for it self with any hopes of Success, 
otherwise than by preparing the deluded World by a false 
prospect of Liberty and Indulgence. The inward Springs and 
Wheels whereby the Engine moved, are now so fully laid open 
and expos'd that it is not supposable that such a baffled Ex- 
periment should ever be tryed again; the effect it had at the 
time, and the Spirit it raised, will not easily be forgotten, and 
it may be presumed the remembrance of it may secure us from 
any more attempts of that Nature for the future; we must no 
more break a Law to give Men ease, than we are to Rifle an 
House with a devout intention of giving the plunder to the 
Poor; in this case, our Compassion would be as ill directed, as 
our Charity in the other. 

In short, the veneration due to the Laws is never to be thrown 
off, let the pretences be never so specious; yet with all this he 
cannot bring himself to think, that an extraordinary diligence to 
take the uttermost penalty of Laws, upon the poor offending 
Neighbour, is of it self such an all sufficient vertue, that without 
any thing else to recommend Men, it should Entitle them to 
all kind of Preferments and Rewards; he would not detract 
from the merits of those who execute the Laws, yet he cannot 
think such a piece of service as this, can entirely change the 
Man, and either make him a better Divine, or a more knowing 
Magistrate than he was before, especially if it be done with a 
partial and unequal hand in Reverence to greater and more 
dangerous Offenders. 

Our Trimmer would have those mistaken Men ready to throw 
themselves into the arms of the Church, and he would have 
those arms as ready to receive them that shall come to us; he 
would have no supercilious look to fright those strayed Sheep 
from coming into the Fold again; no ill-natur'd maxims of an 
Eternal suspicion, or a belief that those who have once been in 
the wrong can never be in the right again; but a visible prepara-
