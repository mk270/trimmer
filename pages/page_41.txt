contending Powers, who gave us all their Courtship, and offer'd 
all their Incense at our Altar, whilst the Fate of either Prince 
seemed to depend upon the Oracles we delivered; for the King 
of England to sit on his Throne, a& in the Supream Court of 
Justice, to which the two great Monarchs appeal, pleading their 
Cause, and expecting their Sentence declaring which side was 
in the right, or at least if we pleas'd which side should have the 
better of it, was a piece of Greatness which was peculiar to us, 
and no wonder if we endeavoured to preserve it, as we did for 
a considerable time, it being our Safety, as well as Glory, to 
maintain it; but by a Fatality upon our Councils, or by the re- 
fin'd Policy of this latter Age, we have thought fit to use 
industry to destroy this mighty Power, which we have so long 
enjoyed; and that equality between the Two Monarchs, which 
we might for ever have preserved, hath been chiefly broken by 
us, whose Interest it was above all others to maintain it; when 
one of them, like the overflowing of the Sea, had gained more 
upon the other than our convenience, or indeed our safety, 
would allow, instead of mending the Banks, or making new 
ones, we our selves with our own hands helpt to cut them, to 
invite and make way for a farther Inundation. France and 
Spain have had their several turns in making use of our Mistakes, 
and we have been formerly as deaf to the Instances of the then 
weaker part of the World to help them against the House of 
Austria, as we can now be to the Earnestness of Spain, that we 
would assist them against the Power of France. Gondamar was 
as sawcy, and as powerful too in King James his Court, as any 
French Ambassadour can have been at any time since; Men 
talked as wrong then on the Spanish side, and made their Court 
by it as well as any can have done since by talking as much for 
the French; so that from that time, instead of weighing in 
a wise Balance the power of either Crown, it looketh as if we 
had learnt only to weigh the Pensions, and take the heaviest. 

It would be tedious, as well as unwelcome, to recapitulate all 
our wrong steps, so that I will go no farther than the King's 
Restauration, at which time the Balance was on the side of 
France, and that by the means of Cromwell, who for a separate
