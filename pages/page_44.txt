___a I_y Fuotn_en who had quitted their Masters Livery, we all
tooh it a__ain, a1__ 1'eturned to our ol_ Service; so that the very
tin_e of doing it ga_e a very critical Ad_antage to Fra1zce, since   ,

_vell as to their Fashion, and _4oul_ giye such 4 dist_'ust of us    '
to our __e__ Allies, th_t it might f4cilitate the _issolution of the
h_Jot, ___icl_ tied them so __jthin their bounds, that th_y _ere
veI'y impatient till they were freed fro In the l.estraint.
But the Lady had a more e_te_Jded Comn_ission tl_an this _n_
_vithout doubt laid the _o_nd_tion of a __ew s_'   At_a_ce,
_uite coTItrary to the other in which we had been so lately
e11g__d.  And of thiS there were s_cl_ early appearances, that
the __orld be__an to lo_o_h upon us as falli_Jg into _A. po_t__acy f____'on_ _
the common _Interest.  Notwithstanding _ll this, Fra1zce _id
not neglect at the same time to give goo_ _Tol'ds to the D_tc_,

us, _he__ on a sudden, that never to be forgotten DecIaration of
War ag_inst them con_etl_ out, only to _indicate his own Glory,
_nd to revenge the In_uries done to his B_'other in _ng Za__, by
__hich he becan_e ol_r Sec_nd in thi6 Duel; so humble can tl-_iS
Prince be, when at the san_e tin_e he doth us more Honou_' than
_ve des_r_e, he layeth a greater sh__'e of the blame upon our
Shoulders, than did naturally belong to us; the paTticula_'s of
that War, oI_r part in it _hile _Te stai_ in it, and when _ve were
out of breath, our leaving the Fre_c_ to mahe an end of it, are
things too _ell hno_n to nJahe it necessary, and too un_Telcome
in themselves to incite me to _'epeat thenJ; only the w1'sdom of
France is i__ this to be observ'd, That when  _Te had n_ade
a separate Peace, which left the1__ single to oppose the united
Force of t I_e Confederates, they __ere so f_l' from being an__ry,
that they would not she__ so much _s the least coldness, hoping
to get as much by our Mediatio__ fo1' _ Peace, 3s they would
have expected from our Assist_nce in the War, ouI' Circum-
stances at  that ti_ne considered;  This  seasonable  piece of
Indulgence in not rep_'oaching us, but rathe_' allo_Ting those
Necessities of State _Thich we ga_e fur our E_cuse, _vas s_ch
an engaging Method, that it went a great w_y to _eep us still
