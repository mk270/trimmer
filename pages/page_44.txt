many Footmen who had quitted their Masters Livery, we all 
took it again, and returned to our old Service; so that the very 
time of doing it gave a very critical Advantage to France, since 
it lookt like an Evidence of our returning to their Interest, as 
well as to their Fashion, and would give such a distrust of us 
to our new Allies, that it might facilitate the dissolution of the 
knot, which tied them so within their bounds, that they were 
very impatient till they were freed from the restraint. 

But the Lady had a more extended Commission than this and 
without doubt laid the Foundation of a new strict Alliance, 
quite contrary to the other in which we had been so lately 
engaged. And of this there were such early appearances, that 
the World began to look upon us as falling into Apostacy from 
the common Interest. Notwithstanding all this, France did 
not neglect at the same time to give good words to the Dutch, 
and even to feed them with hopes of supporting them against

and to revenge the Injuries done to his Brother in England, by 
which he became our Second in this Duel; so humble can this 
Prince be, when at the same time he doth us more Honour than

things too well known to make it necessary, and too unwelcome 
in themselves to incite me to repeat them; only the wisdom of 
France is in this to be observed, That when we had made 
a separate Peace, which left them single to oppose the united 
Force of the Confederates, they were so far from being angry, 
that they would not shew so much as the least coldness, hoping 
to get as much by our Mediation for a Peace, as they would 
have expected from our Assistance in the War, our Circum- 
stances at that time considered; This seasonable piece of 
Indulgence in not reproaching us, but rather allowing those 
Necessities of State which we gave for our Excuse, was such 
an engaging Method, that it went a great way to keep us still
