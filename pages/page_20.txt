Religion hath such a Superiority above other things, and that 
indispensable Influence upon all Mankind, that it is as neces- 
sary to our Living Happy in this World, as it is to our being 
Sav'd in the next, without it man is an abandon 'd Creature, one 
of the worst Beasts Nature hath produc'd, and fit only for the 
Society of Wolves and Bears; therefore in all Ages it hath been 
the Foundation of Government: and tho' false Gods have been 
impos'd upon the Credulous part of the World, yet they were 
Gods still in their Opinion, and the Awe and Reverence Men 
had to them and their Oracles, kept them within bounds to- 
wards one another, which the Laws with all their Authority 
could never have effected without the help of Religion; the 
Laws would not be able to subdue the perverseness of Mens 
Wills, which are Wild Beasts, and require a double Chain 
to keep them down; for this Reason 'tis said, That it is 
not a sufficient ground to make War upon a Neighbouring 
State, because they are of another Religion, let it be never so 
differing; yet if they Worship nor Acknowledge no Deity at all, 
they may be Invaded as Publick Enemies of Mankind, because 
they reject the only thing that can bind them to live well with 
one another; the consideration of Religion is so twisted with 
that of Government, that it is never to be separated, and tho the 
Foundations of it ought to be Eternal and Unchangeable, yet 
the Terms and Circumstances of Discipline, are to be suited to 
the several Climates and Constitutions, so that they may keep 
men in a willing Acquiescence unto them, without discomposing 
the World by nice disputes, which can never be of equal moment 
with the publick Peace. 

Our Religion here in England seemeth to be distinguished by 
a peculiar effect of God Almighty's goodness, in permiting it 
to be introduced, or rather restored, by a more regular Method 
than the Circumstances of most other Reformed Churches would 
allow them to do, in relation to the Government; and the
