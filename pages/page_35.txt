Trust was tolerably kept as to their outward Form, yet there 
were many Circumstances, which being improved by the quick- 
sighted Malice of ill affected Men, did help to keep up the 
World in their suspicions, and to blow up Jealousies to such 
a height both in and out of Parliament, that the remembrance 
of them is very unpleasant, and the Example so extravagant, 
that it is to be hop'd nothing in our Age like it will be re- 
attempted; but to come closer to the Case in question: in this 
Condition we stand with the Papists, what shall now be done, 
according to our Trimmer's Opinion, in order to the better 
Bearing this grievance, since as I have said before, there is no

not to accompt till the Day of Judgment, which is a good 
kind of Tenure, and ye cannot well blame the good Men, that 
will stir up the Laity to run any hazard in order to the getting 
them restored. What is it to the Priest, if the deluded Zealot 
undoeth himself in the Attempt? he singeth Masses as jollily, 
and with as good a Voice at Rome or St. Omers as ever he 
did; is a single Man, and can have no wants but such as 
may be easily supply'd, yet that he may not seem altogether 
insensible, or ungrateful to those that are his Martyrs, he is 
ready to assure their Executors, and if they please, will procure 
a Grant sub Annulo Piscatoris, that the good Man by being
