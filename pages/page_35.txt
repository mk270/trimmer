_Tei'e many Ci_'c_mstances, __hich being i In_l'oved by the qwch-
, sighted Malice of ill a_ected Me1_, did help to heep _p the
World in tI_ei_' suspicio1_s, and to blow up Jealousies to s_ch

that it is to be hop'd __othing in our Age lihe it will be Te-

hopes of being entir_ly fTee from it;  Papists we n_ust have
among __s, and if theil'  Religion  keep them fl'om bringing
honey to the Hive, let the Government try _t least by ge_tle
