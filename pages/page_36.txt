some hundred of years, which he would else have had in 
Purgatory. There's no Cure for this Order of Men, no Ex- 
pedient to be propos'd, so that tho the utmost severity of 
the Laws against them may in some sort be mitigated, yet no 
Treaty can be made with Men who in this Case have left them- 
selves no free Will, but are so muffled by Zeal, tyed by Vows, 
and kept up by such unchangeable Maxims of the Priesthood, 
that they are to be left as desperate Patients, and look'd upon 
as Men that will continue in an Eternal State of Hostility, till 
the Nation is entirely subdued to them. It is then only the 
Lay Papists that are capable of being treated with, and we are 
to examine of what temper they are, and what Arguments are

cluding them from Publick Business, and it happeneth well 
they are so, since they will the more easily be perswaded by 
Arguments of Ease and Conveniency to them; they have not 
put off the Man in general, nor the Englishman in particular, 
those who in the late storm against them went into other 
Countries, tho they had all the Advantage that might recom- 
mend them to a good Reception, yet in a little time they chose 
to steal over again, and live here with hazard, rather than 
abroad with security. There is a Smell in our Native Earth, 
better than all the Perfumes in the East; there is something
