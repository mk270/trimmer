Life and Vigour which is necessary to produce great things, 
whereas the virtual Consent of the whole being included in their 
Representatives, and the King giving the sanction to the united 
sense of the People, every Act done by such an Authority, 
seemeth to be an effect of their choice as well as a part of their 
Duty; and they do, with an eagerness of which Men are un- 
capable whilst under a force, execute whatsoever is so enjoyned 
as their own Wills, better explained by Parliament, rather than 
from the terrour of incurring the Penalty of the Law for omit- 
ing it, and by means of this Political Omnipotence, what ever 
Sap or Juice there is in a Nation, may be to the last drop 
produced, whilst it riseth naturally from the Root; whereas all 
power exercis'd without consent, is like the giving Wounds and 
Gashes, and tapping a Tree at unseasonable Times, for the 
present occasion, which in a very little time must needs de-

Our Trimmer believeth, that by the advantage of our Situa-

but that the King may have time enough left to consult with 
his Physicians in Parliament; pretences indeed may be made, 
but a real necessity so pressing, that no delay is to be admitted,

Presume it will ever happen for the time to come: but if that 
strange thing should fall out, our Trimmer is not so streight- 
lac'd, as to let a Nation die, or to be stifled, rather than it 
should be help'd by any but the proper Officers. The Cases 
themselves will bring the Remedies along with them; and he 
is not afraid to allow that in order to its preservation, there is 
a hidden Power in Government, which would be lost if it was 
defined, a certain Mystery, by virtue of which a Nation may at 
some Critical times be secur'd from Ruine; but then it must be 
kept as a Mystery; it is rendred useless when touch 'd by un- 
skilfull hands, and no Government ever had, or deserv'd to 
have that Power, which was so unwary as to anticipate their 
claim to it: Our Trimmer cannot help thinking it had been 
better, if the Triennial Act had been observed; because 'tis the
