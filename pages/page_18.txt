Life and _igour which is nece6sary to produce great things,
_vhereas the virtual Consent of the _hole being included in their
Representatives, and the King giving the sanction to the united
sense of the People, every Act done by such an Authority,
seemeth to be an e_ect of their choice as _vell as a pa__t of thei_'
Dut5_; and they do, with an eagerness of 'which Me_ _re u1_-
cap___e _hilst under a force, execute whatsoever is so en_oyned
_s their own Wills, better explained by Parliament, rather than
f_m the terrour of incurring the Pen4_ lty of the Law for omit-
i __B it, a__d b)_ __eans of this Political Omnipotence, what ever
Sap or J__ice there is in _ Nation, may be to the last dro_J
prod_c'd, _hilst it riseth naturally from the Root; whereas all
po_er exercis'd without consent, is lihe the giving Wounds and
Gashes, and tapping a Tree at unseasonable Times, for the
_resent occasion, which in _ very little time mu9t needs d__
stroy it.
Our _i1nmer believeth, that by the advantage of our Situa-
tion, there can hardly any s_ch sudden Disease come upon us,

but a real necessity so pressi__g, that no delay is to be adn_itted,
is h_dly to be imagińd, and it will be neither easie to give an
instance of any such thing for the time past, or reaso_1able to
Presume it will e__er happen for the time to come: but if that,
strange _ing should f_ll o_t, our TVi1J_1ner is not so streight- ,
lac'd, as to let a Nation die, ol' to b_ stiAed, rather than it
should be help_ by _ny but the prope_' Omcers.  The Cases

is not afr_id to allow that in order to its preserv_tion, there is
a hidden Po_vel_ in Governme_t, _vhich would be lost if it _Tas

gon_e Critjcal tin_es be secur'd fl'om Ruine; but then it must be
kept as a M_stery; it is re_dred useless _he__ t,ouch_ by un-
