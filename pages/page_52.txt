Planet are not yet all spent, and tho the Stars of Men past their 
youth are generally declining, and have less Force, like the Eyes 
of decaying Beauties, yet by a Blessing peculiar to himself, we 
may yet hope to be sav'd by his Autumnal Fortune; He hath 
something about him that will draw down a healing Miracle for 
his and our Deliverance; a Prince which seemeth fitted for such 
an offending Age, in which Mens Crimes have been so general, 
that the not forgiving his People had been the destroying of 
them; whose Gentleness giveth him a natural Dominion that 
hath no bounds, with such a noble mixture of Greatness and 
Condescention, an engaging Look, that disarmeth Men of their ill 
Humours, and their Resentments; something in him that 
wanteth a Name, and can be no more defined than it can be 
resisted; a Gift of Heaven, of its last finishing, where it will be 
peculiarly kind; the only Prince in the World that dares be 
familiar, or that hath right to triumph over those forms which 
were first invented to give awe to those who could not judge, 
and to hide Defects from those that could; a Prince that hath 
exhausted himself by his Liberality, and endangered himself by 
his Mercy; who out-shineth by his own Light and natural 
Virtues all the varnish of studied Acquisitions; his Faults are 
like Shades to a good Picture, or like Allay to Gold, to make 
it the more useful; he may have some, but for any Man to see 
them through so many reconciling Virtues, is a Sacrilegious 
piece of ill nature, of which no generous Mind can be guilty; 
a Prince that deserveth to be lov'd for his own sake, even 
without the help of a Comparison; our Love, our Duty, and 
our Danger all join to cement our Obedience to him; in short, 
whatever he can do, it is no more possible for us to be angry 
with him, than with the Bank that secureth us from the raging 
Sea, the kind Shade that hideth us from the scorching Sun, 
the welcome Hand that reacheth us a Reprieve, or with the 
Guardian Angel, that rescueth our Souls from the devouring 
Jaws of wretched Eternity.
