Planet al'e not yet all spent, and tho the Stars of Men __st their
youth are geneTally dec_lining, _nd ha_e less Fo_'ce, lil_e the Eyes
of decayi__g Bea_ties, _et by a BIessing peculia_' to himself, _ve
n_ay yet hope to be sa_d by his A_tumnal Fortu_e;  He hath
something about hi_n that __ill dra_4 d_4n a healing Miracle for
his and our DeliveT__nce; a Prince which seemeth 6tted for s__ch      J
_n oï¬€ending Age, in which Mens Crimes have been so gene1'al,
that the not forgivi1_g his Peo_le had been the destroying of
then_; whose Gentleness giTetl_ him a natural Do__inion th_t
hath no bounds, _ith such a noble n_ixture of Greatness and
Condescention, an engaging Looh, that disaT_neth Men of their ill
HumouTs,  and  thei_'  _esentments;  something i__  hi_n  that
__anteth a Name, _nd can be no more de_ned than it ca__ be
resisted; a Gift of Heaven, of its last _nishing, whel'e it will be       ''_,
eculiaTly hind; the only Pri_ce in the Wol'ld that dares be       ' ,.
f___iliar, oT that hath _'ight to triumph oveT those forms which       _
were _Tst in_ented tu give awe to those who could not _udee,   _  ,._t_
and to hide Defects from those that cuuId; _ Prince that hath    :   '_
e_hausted himself by _is Liberality, and endange_d __imself by     '' '
his MeTcp;  _ho out-shineth by his o_n Light and natural
Vi_ues all the __arnish of studied Acquisitions; his F_ults are
li_e Shades to a good Pic_ure, oT lihe Allay to Gold, to malce
it the more useful; he may have some, but for a__y Man to see
them through so man__ reco__ciling Virtues, is a Sacrilegious
iece of ill nature, of which no generous Mind can be guilty;
a __nce that  deserveth to be lov'd for his own sahe, e_en
_ithout the help of a Comparison; our Lo_e, our Duty, and
our Dange_' all _oi__ to cement our Obedience to hin_;  _n shol't,
whatever he c_n do, it is no more possible for us to be angry
wjth him, than _ith t.he Banh that secureth us fl'om thc raging
Sea, the kind Shade t__t hi_et}_ us from the sc'o_'ching Sun,
the welcon_e Hand t__at reacheth us a Reprie__e, or _ith the
GuaTdian Angel, that rescueth our Souls from the de_ouril_g
Ja_s of _Tretched EteTnity,                        ;,
