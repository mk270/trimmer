their dull malice at the Head of those they do not like; such
things ever begin in Jest, and end in Blood, and the same word
which at first maketh the Company merry, groweth in time to a
Military Signal to cut one anothers Throats.

These Mistakes are to be lamented, tho' not easily cured,
being suitable enough to the corrupted Nature of Mankind; but
'tis hard, that Men will not only invent ill Names, but they will
wrest and misinterpret good ones; so afraid some are even of
a reconciling sound, that they raise another noise to keep it from
being heard, lest it should set up and encourage a dangerous sort

expos'd, that, were it a true Picture that is made of him, it
would be enough to fright Children, and make Women miscarry
at the sight of it.

But it may be worth the examining, whether he is such a Beast
as he is Painted.  I am not of that Opinion, and am so far
