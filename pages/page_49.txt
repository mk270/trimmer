belief for greater things, and as he that taught Men to eat 
a Dagger, began first with a Pen knife; so if we can be prevailed 
with to digest the smaller Mistakes, we may at last make our 
stomachs strong enough for that of Transubstantiation. Our 
Trimmer cannot easily be converted out of his senses by these 
State Sophisters, and yet he hath no such peevish Obstinacy as 
to reject all Correspondence with France because we ought to 
be apprehensive of the too great power of it; he would not have 
the kings Friendship to the Confederates extended to the in- 
volving him in any unreasonable or dangerous Engagements, 
neither would he have him lay aside the consideration of his 
better establishment at home, out of his excessive Zeal to secure 
his Allies abroad; but sure there might be a Mean between 
these two opposite Extreams, and it may be wished that our 
Friendship with France should at least be so bounded, that it 
may consist with the humour as well as the Interest of England.

the Confederates, to look like the Kitching- Yacht to the Grand 
Louis, is but a scurvy Figure for us to make in the Map of 
Christendom', it would rise upon our Trimmer's stomach, if 
ever (which God forbid) the power of calling and intermitting 
Parliaments here should be transferred to the Crown of France, 
and that all the opportunities of our own settlements at home 
should give way to their Projects abroad, and that our Interests 
should be so far sacrific'd to our Compliance, that all the Omni- 
potence of France can never make us full amends for it. In 
the mean time, he shrinketh at the dismal prospect he can by 
no means drive away from his thoughts, that when France hath 
gathered all the fruit arising from our Mistakes, and that we
