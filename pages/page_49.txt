__'ith to digest the smaller Mistahe_, we _ay at last _ahe ouI'

Tr2_172er cannot easily be converted out of his senses by these
State Sophisters, and yet he hath no suc_ peevish Obstinacy as
to reJect all Correspondence with FraJ2ce hecause we ought to
be appTehensive of the too great po_er of it; he would not have
the hings F_'iendship to the ConfedeT_tes extended to tl_e in-

his Allies abroad;  but sure the_'e might be a Mean _bet_ween

Friendship with mance should at lcast be so bounded, that it

There is no Woman but hath heT fears of co__tracting too near
an intimacy with a much greater Beauty, because it exposeth
her too often to a CompaTison that is not advantageous to her;
and sure it ma_ become a Prince to be as Ĵealous of his Dignity,
as a Lady can be of heT goo_ louhs, and to be as much out of
Countenance, to be thought an humble Companion to su much
a gTeater Powe_'.  To be always e_,en in an ill _Meh4--to be so
da_'hned by the brightness of a greater Star, is somewhatmoTti-
f_7_g; and when _J2glan_ might ride Admiral at the head of
the Confederates, to looh li_e the Kitcbi__g-_acht to the GTand

the mean time, he shrinheth at the dismal prospect he can by
no means d_ve away from his thoughts, that when maJ2ce hath
