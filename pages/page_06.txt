is as bad, that Obedience shall be look'd upon as a better
Qualification in a Judge, than Skill or Integrity, when such sacred
things as the Laws are not only touch'd, but guided by prophane
hands; Men will fear that out of the Tree of the Law, from
whence we expect Shade and Shelter, such Workmen will make
Cudgels to beat us with, or rather that they will turn the Canon
upon our Properties, that were intrusted with them for their
Defence.

To see the Laws Mangled, Disguised, Speak quite another
Language than their own, to see them thrown from the Dignity
of protecting Mankind, to the disgraceful Office of destroying
them; and notwithstanding their Innocence in themselves, to      '
be made the worst Instruments that the most refined Villany
can make use of, will raise Mens Anger above the power of
laying it down again, and tempt them to follow the Evil
Examples given them of Judging without Hearing, when so
provoked by their desire of Revenge.  Our Trimmer therefore,
as he thinketh the Laws are Jewels, so he believeth they are
nowhere better set, than in the constitution of our English
Government, if rightly understood, and carefully preserved.

It would be too great Partiality to say they are perfect or 
liable to no Objection; such things are not of this world; but 
if they have more Excellencies and fewer Faults than any other 
we know, it is enough to recommend them to our Esteem.

The Dispute, which is a greater Beauty, a Monarchy or a 
Common-wealth, hath lasted long between their contending 
Lovers, and they have behav'd themselves so like Lovers, (who 
in good Manners must be out of their Wits,) who used such 
Figures to exalt their own Idols on either side, and such angry 
Aggravations, to reproach one another in the Contest, that 
moderate men have in all times smil'd upon this eagerness, 
and thought it differ'd very little from a downright Frenzy: 
we in England, by a happy use of the Controversie, conclude 
them both in the wrong, and reject them from being our 
Pattern, not taking the words in the utmost extent, which is 
Monarchy, a thing that leaveth men no Liberty, and a Common- 
wealth, such a one as alloweth them no Quiet.
