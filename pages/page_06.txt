is as bad, that Obedience shall be look'd upon as a better
Qualification in a Judge, than Skill or Integrity, when such sacred
things as the Laws are not only touch'd, but guided by prophane
hands; Men will fear that out of the Tree of the Law, from
whence we expect Shade dnd Shelter, such Workmen will make
Cudgels to beat us with, or rather that they will turn the Canon
upon our Properties, that were intrusted vith them for their
Defence.

To see the Laws Mangled, Disguised, Speak quite another
Language than their own, to see them thrown from the Dignity
of protecting Mankind, to the disgraceful Office of destroying
them; and notwithstanding their Innocence in themselves, to      '
be made the worst Instruments that the most refined Villany
can make use of, will raise Mens Anger above the power of
laying it down again, and tempt them to follow the Evil
Examples given them of Judging without Hearing, when so
provoked by their desire of Revenge.  Our Trimmer therefore,
as he thinketh the Laws are Jewels, so he believeth they are
nowhere better set, than in the constitution of our English
Governnment, if rightly understood, and carefully preserved.
