tion of mind to receive with joy all the Proselytes that come 
amongst us, and much greater earnestness to reclaim than 
punish them: It is to be confessed, there is a great deal to 
forgive, a hard task enough for the Charity of a Church so pro- 
voked; but that must not cut off all hopes of being reconciled, 
yet if there must be some anger left still, let it break out into 
a Christian Revenge, and by being kinder to the Children of 
Disobedience than they deserve, let the injured Church Triumph, 
by throwing shame and confusion of face upon them; there 
should not always be Storms and Thunder, a clear Sky would 
sometime make the Church look more like Heaven, and would 
do more towards the reclaiming those wanderers, than a per- 
petual terrour, which seemeth to have no intermission; for there 
is in many, and particularly in English Men, a mistaken 
pleasure, in resisting the dictates of Rigorous Authority; a 
Stomach that riseth against a hard imposition, nay, in some, 
even a lust in suffering from a wrong point of Honour, 
which doth not want the applause, from the greater part of 
Mankind, who have not learnt to distinguish; constancy will 
be thought a virtue even where it is a mistake; and the ill 
Judging World will be apt to think that Opinion most right, 
which produceth the greatest number of those who are willing 
to suffer for it; all this is prevented, and falleth to the ground, 
by using well-timed Indulgence; and the stubborn Adversary 
who valueth himself upon his Resistance whilst he is oppress'd, 
yieldeth insensibly to kind Methods, when they are apply'd to 
him, and the same Man naturally melteth into Conformity, who 
perhaps would never have been beaten into it. We may be 
taught by the Compassion that attendeth the most Criminal 
Men when they are Condemned, that Faults are much more 
natural things than Punishments, and that even the most 
necessary acts of severity do some kind of violence to our 
Nature, whose Indulgence will not be confined within the 
strait bounds of inexorable Justice; so that this should be an 
Argument for gentleness, besides that it is the likeliest way to 
make these Men ashamed of their Separation, whilst the pressing 
them too hard, tendeth rather to make them proud of it.
