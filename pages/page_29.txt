nJent _ould be _vithout Ob_ection, the Penalties being e_acteil
___ithout Ren_ission fr_m the Dissenters of all hinds; o_' if t.hat
_Ti_ not be done (an_ indeed there i_ _o Re__son it should) there
is a necessity of su_1_e Connivance to the Protestant Dissenter6
to excuse that _vhich in  Humc_nity n_ust be allo__ed to the
_apists, e_en __thout any leaning to_ards then_, which I__ust
not be supposed in those who are or shall be in the adn_inistra-
tioI1 of p_bliL_h Business; and it _ilI follow that, according to
our CiI'cun_stances, the distribution of such conni_ance must
be n_ade in s_1ch a _nanner, that the gre_te_t part of it may fall
on the Protest_nt side, or else the ObJection_ _ill be so StrOn6,
_n_ the Ir,ferences so clear, th_t the F_'iends, as _ell as the
_ne_nies of the Crown, will _e sure to tahe hold of them.
It _Till not be sumcient to say that the Papists may b_
conni_d at,  b_cause the- y a1'e good Subjects  _' nd that the

is, tl_is Matter s_e_hs so n_uch of it self, that it is not only
unnecessa_'y,  but it  ___ay be  un1n_nnerly to  say  any  n_ore
of it.
O_1r Tr21n1ner therefore could wish, that since notwitI_standin6
the Laws vhich den.y Churches ..to .sa_ Mass in, not only the

_erformed in the Chap_els of so many Foreign Min. i_s__ers, where
the _ngZ2s_ openlp resort in spight of Proclamations and Orders
of Council, which are growl1 to be as harmless things to then_,
as the Pupes Bulls and Excommunications  are  to He_'etichs
who are out of  his _'each;  I  _ay he  could wish that by a
