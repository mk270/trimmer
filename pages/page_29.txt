ment would be without Objection, the Penalties being exacted 
without Remission from the Dissenters of all kinds; or if that 
will not be done (and indeed there is no Reason it should) there 
is a necessity of some Connivance to the Protestant Dissenters 
to excuse that which in Humanity must be allowed to the 
Papists, even without any leaning towards them, which must 
not be supposed in those who are or shall be in the administra- 
tion of publick Business; and it will follow that, according to 
our Circumstances, the distribution of such connivance must 
be made in such a manner, that the greatest part of it may fall 
on the Protestant side, or else the Objections will be so strong, 
and the Inferences so clear, that the Friends, as well as the 
Enemies of the Crown, will be sure to take hold of them. 

It will not be sufficient to say that the Papists may be 
conniv'd at, because they are good Subjects and that the 
Protestant Dissenters must suffer because they are ill ones; 
these general Maxims will not convince discerning Men, neither 
will any late Instances make them forget what passed at other 
times in the World; both sides have had their Turns in being 
good and ill Subjects. And therefore 'tis easie to imagine what 
suspicions would arise in the present conjuncture, if such a 
partial Argument as this should be impos'd upon us; the truth 
is, this Matter speaks so much of it self, that it is not only 
unnecessary, but it may be unmannerly to say any more 
of it. 

Our Trimmer therefore could wish, that since notwithstanding 
the Laws which deny Churches to say Mass in, not only the 
Exercise, but also the Ostentation of Popery is as well or better 
performed in the Chappels of so many Foreign Ministers, where 
the English openly resort in spight of Proclamations and Orders 
of Council, which are grown to be as harmless things to them, 
as the Popes Bulls and Excommunications are to Hereticks 
who are out of his reach; I say he could wish that by a 
seasonable as well as an equal piece of Justice, there might 
be so much consideration had of the Protestant Dissenters, as 
that there might be at some times, and at some places, a Veil 
thrown over an Innocent and retired Conventicle; and that
