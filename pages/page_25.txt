Our Trimmer would have the Clergy supported in their 
Lawful Rights, and in all the Power and Dignity that belongeth 
to them, and yet he thinketh that possibly there may be in 
some of them a too great eagerness to extend the Ecclesiastical 
Jurisdiction; which tho it may be well intended, yet the strain- 
ing of it too high hath an appearance of Ambition that raiseth 
mens Objections to it, and is so far unlike the Apostolick 
Zeal, which was quite otherwise employ'd, that the World 
draweth inferences from it, which do the Church no service. 

He is troubled to see Men of all sides sick of a Calenture 
of a mistaken Devotion, and it seemeth to him that the devout 
Fire of mistaken Charity with which the Primitive Christians 
were inflam'd, is long since extinguished, and instead of it a 
devouring Fire of Anger and Persecution breaketh out in the 
World; we wrangle now one with another about Religion till 
the Blood cometh, whilst the Ten Commandments have no 
more authority with us, than if they were so many obsolete 
Laws or Proclamations out of date; he thinketh that a Nation 
will hardly be mended by Principles of Religion, where 
Morality is made a Heresy; and therefore as he believeth 
Devotion misplaced when it gets into a Conventicle, he con- 
cludeth that Loyalty is so too, when lodg'd in a Drunken Club; 
those Vertues deserve a better Seat of Empire, and they are 
degraded, when such Men undertake their defence, as have too 
great need of an Apology themselves. 

Our Trimmer wisheth that some knowledge may go along 
with the Zeal on the right side, and that those who are in 
possession of the Pulpit, would quote at least so often the 
Authority of the Scriptures as they do that of the State; there are 
many who borrow too often Arguments from the Government, 
to use against their Adversaries, and neglect those that are 
more proper, and would be more powerful; a Divine groweth 
less, and putteth a diminution on his own Character, when he 
quoteth any Law but that of God Almighty, to get the better 
of those who contest with him; and as it is a sign of a decay'd 
Constitution, when Nature with good diet cannot expel noxious 
Humours without calling Foreign Drugs to her Assistance;
