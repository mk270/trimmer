Compliance, it did _lut me_n to Ieave o_ the purguit o_ their

brances o? _hat ha_ passed before, had le?t such an ill taste in
their Mo_tks, that they could not Relish our being put into
a Condition to dispose of their Interests, and therefore decIin'd
it bp insisting upon a general Treaty, to which Fra12ce hath
ever since continued to be a_erse; our _eat earnestness also to
peTs_Tade the Confeder_tes to consent to it, was so unusual, and
so suspicious a method, that it might naturaIl_ mahe them
believe, that FraJ2ce spahe to them by our Mo_t_, and for that
Reason, if there had been no othel', might hinder the accepting
it; and so IittIe care hath been tahen to cure this ol' other
