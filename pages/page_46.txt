Example, are as effectual as Fleets and Armies, because they 
can create them, and without this his words sound abroad like 
a faint Whisper, that is either not heard, or (which is worse) 
not minded. But tho France had made this step of forced 
Compliance, it did not mean to leave off the pursuit of their 
pretensions; and therefore immediately proposed the Arbitration 
to the King; but it appeared, that notwithstanding his Merit 
towards the Confederates, in saving Luxenburg, the remem- 
brances of what had passed before, had left such an ill taste in 
their Mouths, that they could not Relish our being put into 
a Condition to dispose of their Interests, and therefore declined 
it by insisting upon a general Treaty, to which France hath 
ever since continued to be averse; our great earnestness also to 
perswade the Confederates to consent to it, was so unusual, and 
so suspicious a method, that it might naturally make them 
believe, that France spake to them by our Mouth, and for that 
Reason, if there had been no other, might hinder the accepting 
it; and so little care hath been taken to cure this or other 
Jealousies the Confederates may have entertain'd, that quite 
contrary, their Ministers here every day take fresh Alarms, 
from what they observe in small, as well as in greater Circum- 
stances; and they being apt both to take and improve appre- 
hensions of this kind, draw such Inferences from them, as make 
them entirely despair of us.

a Certain Fore-runner it is to our own; and now it is time our 
Trimmer should tell something of his Opinion, upon this present 
State of things abroad; he first professeth to have no Biass, 
either for or against France, and that his thoughts are wholly 
directed by the Interest of his own Country; he alloweth, and 
hath read that Spain used the same Methods, when it was in 
its heighth, as France doth now, and therefore it is not Partiality 
that moveth him, but the just fear which all reasonable Men 
must be possess'd with, of an over-growing Power; Ambition 
is a devouring Beast, when it hath swallow'd one Province, 
instead of being cloyed, it hath so much the greater Stomach
