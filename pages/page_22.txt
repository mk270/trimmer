the most repeated Provocations; if a right thing agreeable to 
Nature and good Sense taketh root in the heart of a Man that 
is impartial and unbyass'd, no outward Circumstances can ever 
destroy it; it is true, the degrees of a Mans Zeal for the Prosecu- 
tion of it may be differing; the faults of other Men, the con- 
sideration of the publick, and the seasonable Prudence by which 
Wise Men will ever be directed, may give great Allays; they 
may lessen and for a time perhaps suppress the exercise of that, 
which in general Proposition may be reasonable, but still what- 
ever is so will inevitably grow and spring up again, having 
a Foundation in Nature, which is never to be destroyed. 

Our Trimmer therefore endeavoureth to separate the detesta- 
tion of those who had either a hand or a thought in the late 
Plot, from the Principle of Prudential as well as Christian 
Charity towards Mankind, and for that reason would fain use 
the means of reclaiming such of the Dissenters as are not in- 
curable, and even of bearing to a degree those that are, as far as 
may consist with the Publick Interest and Security; he is far 
from justifying an affected separation from the Communion of 
the Church, and even in those that mean well and are mistaken, 
he looketh upon it as a Disease that hath seized upon their 
Minds, very troublesome as well as dangerous, by the Conse- 
quence it may produce: he doth not go about to excuse their 
making it an indispensable duty, to meet in numbers to say 
their Prayers; such meetings may prove mischievous to the 
State; at least the Laws, which are the best Judges, have 
determined that there is danger in them: he hath good nature 
enough to lament that the perversness of a Part should have 
drawn Rigorous Laws upon the whole Body of the Dissenters, 
but when they are once made no private Opinion must stand in 
Opposition to them; if they are in themselves reasonable, they 
are in that respect to be regarded, even without being enjoyned; 
if by the Change of Time and Circumstances they should be- 
come less reasonable than when they were first made, even then 
they are to be obey'd too, because they are Laws, till they are 
mended or repealed by the same Authority that Enacted them. 

He hath too much deference to the Constitution of our
