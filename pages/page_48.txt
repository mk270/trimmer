the  Liberties of all  the  Electors and f_'ee St_tes into  his

an aspiI'ing HeI'o, that _ould inf_llibly devour them, if he _vas

Yollan_, he hath the most obliging tenderness for the Co1n_no_2-

Prince of Orange, that they can do _o less in gratitude, than

Faith, and consequently that it is the only Friend we can _'ely
upon ,.  that the Ki__g of France, of all Men living, hath the
leaSt mind to be  a COnqUerOr;  that he ls a  sleepY, taIne
Creature, void of all Ambition, a poor _ind o_ a MaI_, that hath
no farther thoughts than to be quiet; that he is charI_'d by his
Friendship to us; that it is impossible he should ever do us hurt,
_nd therefore tho _lan_ers was lost, it wo_d not in the l_st
concern us; that he would fain h_lp the Crown of _nglan_ to
be _a_____' _e, which _ould be to tahe pains to put it into a con-
dition to oppose him, _s it is, and must be our Intel'est, as
long as _e continueth in such an overballa_lcing Power and
Greatness.
Such a Creed as this, if once _'eceiv'd, might _repare oul'
