selves; and the World hath ground enough to apprehend, from 
such a Method of arguing, that even their Senses are to be 
subdu'd as well as their Liberties. Then the variety of Argu- 
ments used by France in several Countries is very observable: 
In England and Denmark, nothing insisted on but the Greatness 
and Authority of the Crown; on the other side, the Great Men 
in Poland are commended, who differ in Opinion with the King, 
and they argue like Friends to the Privilege of the Dyet, against 
the separate Power of the Crown: In Sweden they are troubled 
that the King should have changed something there of late, by 
his single Authority, from the antient and settled Authority and 
Constitutions: At Ratisbone, the most Christian Majesty taketh 
the Liberties of all the Electors and free States into his 
Protection, and telleth them the Emperour is a dangerous Man, 
an aspiring Hero, that would infallibly devour them, if he was 
not at hand to resist him on their behalf; but above all in 
Holland, he hath the most obliging tenderness for the Common- 
wealth, and is in such disquiets, lest it should be invaded by the 
Prince of Orange, that they can do no less in gratitude, than 
undo themselves when he bids them, to show how sensible they 
are of his excessive good Nature; yet in spight of all these 
Contradictions, there are in the World such refin'd States-men, 
as will upon their Credit affirm the following Paradoxes to be 
real truth; first that France alone is sincere and keepeth its 
Faith, and consequently that it is the only Friend we can rely 
upon; that the King of France, of all Men living, hath the 
least mind to be a Conqueror; that he is a sleepy, tame 
Creature, void of all Ambition, a poor kind of a Man, that hath 
no farther thoughts than to be quiet; that he is charm'd by his 
Friendship to us; that it is impossible he should ever do us hurt, 
and therefore tho Flanders was lost, it would not in the least 
concern us; that he would fain help the Crown of England to 
be absolute, which would be to take pains to put it into a con- 
dition to oppose him, as it is, and must be our Interest, as 
long as he continueth in such an overbalancing Power and 
Greatness. 

Such a Creed as this, if once received, might prepare our
