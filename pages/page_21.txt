Dignity with which it hath supported it self since, and the great 
Men our Church hath produced, ought to recommend it to the 
esteem of all Protestants at least: Our Trimmer is very partial 
to it, for these Reasons, and many more, and desireth that it 
may preserve its due Jurisdiction and Authority; so far he is 
from wishing it oppressed by the unreasonable and malicious 
Cavils of those who take pains to raise Objections against it. 

The Questions will then be, how and by what Methods this 
Church shall best support it self (the present Circumstances 
consider'd) in relation to Dissenters of all sorts: I will first lay 
this for a ground, That as there can be no true Religion with-

while our thoughts are warm, it would almost perswade us to 
put them out of the protection of our good Nature, and to 
think that the Christian Indulgence which our compassion for 
other Mens Sufferings cannot easily deny, seemeth not only to 
be forfeited by the ill appearances that are against them, but 
even becometh a Crime when it is so misapplied; yet for all 
this, upon second and cooler thoughts, moderate Men will not 
be so ready to involve a whole Party in the guilt of a few, and 
to admit inferences and Presumptions to be Evidence in a Case, 
where the Sentence must be so heavy, as it ought to be against 
all those who have a fixed resolution against the Government 
established: besides, Men who act by a Principle grounded 
upon Moral Vertue, can never let it be clearly extinguished, by
