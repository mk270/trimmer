that he had those near him by whom he was otherways advis'd, 
chose rather to run away from her importunity, than by staying 
to bear the continual weight of it: It is believ'd she had better 
success with another of her Sons, who, if he was not quite 
brought off from our Religion, at least such beginnings were 
made, as made them very easie to be finished; his being of 
a generous and aspiring Nature, and in that respect, less patient 
in the drudgery of Arguing, might probably help to recommend 
a Church to him that exempts the Laity from the vexation 
of enquiring; perhaps he might (tho by mistake) look upon 
that Religion as more favourable to the enlarged Power of 
Kings, a consideration which might have its weight with a 
young Prince in his warm blood, and that was brought up 
in Arms. 

I cannot hinder my self from a small digression, to consider 
with admiration, that the old Lady of Rome, with all her

and her Hobby-Horses, whilst the deluded World still con- 
tinueth to furnish her with Customers. 

But whither am I carried with this Contemplation? it is 
high time to return to my Text, and to consider the wonderful 
manner of the Kings coming home again, led by the hand of 
Heaven, and called by the Voice of his own People, who 
received him, if possible, with Joys equal to the Blessing of 
Peace and Union which his Restauration brought along with 
it; by this there was an end put to the hopes some might have 
abroad, of making use of his less happy Circumstances, to 
throw him into Foreign Interests and Opinions, which had 
been wholly inconsistent with our Religion, our Laws, and all 
other things that are dear to us j yet for all this some of those
