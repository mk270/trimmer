that he had those _1eal' hi _n by whom he _as otherways advis'd,
chose r_' tl__r tu run __ay from her importunity, than by stayine
to bear the continual _eight of it: It is believ'd she had betteT
success _vith ____other of her Sons, wl_o, if he _as not quite
brou__ht o_ from o_T Religion, _t least such beginnings _e_e
made, as n1ade them ve_'y' e_sie to be _1_ish'd;  his being of
a generous and aspi_'ing NatuTe, and in that respect, less patient
in the d_'udge_'y of Arguing, TDight probably help to recommend
_ Church  to him that exempts the Laity from the vexatio__
_f enquiring;  pel'haps he might (tho by nlistahe) looh upon
th__t Religion as  _oI'e f_vo_rable to the enlarged Power of

I c_nnot hindeT __y sel_ from a small digre__sion, to conside1'
with  adn_ir_tion, that the old Lady of Ro_e, _ith  all he_'

she sitteth in heT Shop, and selletl_ at dear Rates her Rattles
and  her Hobby-Horses, _vhilst the deluded World still con-
tinueth to fur__ish her with Customers.
But whither al_ T carried _Tith this Contem_lation!  it is
high time to return to n_y Text, and to consider the wonderful
manner of the Kings coming home again, led by the hand of
Heaven,  and  called by the _oice of his o_n  People, who

Peace and Union which his Rest,_uration brougl_t along with

been __olly inconsistent with our Relig-i√≥_, our Laws, and _ll
other things that aTe dear, to u_ s; yet for all this 6on_e of those
