in their Chains, when, to the Eye of the World, we had abso- 
lutely broke loose from them: And by what pass'd afterwards 
at Nimeguen, tho the King's Neutrality gave him the outward 
Figure of a Mediator, it appear'd that his Interposition was 
extremely suspected of Partiality by the Confederates, who upon 
that Ground did both at and before the Conclusion of that 
Treaty, treat his Ministers there with a great deal of neglect. 
In this Peace as well as in that of the Pyreneans and Aix le 
Chapelle, the King of France, at the Moment of making it, had 
the thought of breaking it; for a very little time after he 
broach'd his Pretensions upon Alost', which were things that 
if they had been offer'd by a less formidable hand, would have 
been smiled at; but ill Arguments being seconded by good 
Armies, carry such a power with them, that naked sense is 
a very unequal Adversary. It was thought that these airy 
Claims were chiefly rais'd with the prospect of getting Luxen- 
burg for the Equivalent; and this Opinion was confirmed by the 
blocking it up afterwards, pretending to the Country of Chimay, 
that it might be entirely surrounded by the French Dominions, 
and it was so pressed that it might have fallen in a little time, 
if the King of France had not sent Orders to his Troops to 
retire, and his Christian Generosity which was assign 'd for the 
reason of it, made the World smile, since it is seen how differently 
his devout Zeal worketh in Hungary: that specious Reason 
was in many respects ill-tim'd, and France it self gave it so 
faintly, that at the very time it look'd out of Countenance; 
the true ground of his Retiring is worth our observation; for 
at the instance of the Confederates, Offices were done, and 
Memorials given, but all ineffectual till the word Parliament 
was put into them; that powerful word had such an effect, that 
even at that distance it rais'd the Seige, which may convince us of 
what efficacy the King of England's words are, when he will give 
them their full weight, and threaten with his Parliament; it is 
then that he appeareth that great Figure we ought to represent 
him in our Minds, the Nation his Body, he the Head, and joined 
with that Harmony, that every word he pronounceth is the 
Word of a Kingdom: Such words, as appeareth by this
