Law, and he would not have the Crown, by such an Example, 
teach the Nation to break it; all irregularity is catching, it 
hath a Contagion in it, especially in an Age so much more 
enclin'd to follow ill Patterns than good ones. 

He would have had a Parliament, because 'tis an Essential part 
of the Constitution, even without the Law, it being the only 
Provision in extraordinary Cases, in which there would be other- 
wise no Remedy, and there can be no greater Solecism in 
Government, than a failure of Justice. 

He would have had one, because nothing else can unite and 
heal us, all other Means are meer Shifts and Projects, Houses 
of Cards, to be blown down with the least Breath, and cannot 
resist the Difficulties which are ever presum'd in things of this 
kind; and he would have had one, because it might have 
done the King good, and could not possibly have done him hurt, 
without his consent, which in that Case is not to be supposed, 
and therefore for him to fear it, is so strange and so little to be 
comprehended, that the Reasons can never be presum'd to grow 
in our Soyl, or to thrive in it when Transplanted from any 
other Country; and no doubt there are such irresistible Argu- 
ments for calling a Parliament, that tho it might be deny'd to 
the unmannerly mutinous Petitions of men, that are malicious 
and disaffected, it will be granted to the soft and obsequious 
Murmurs of his Majesty's best Subjects, and there will be such 
Rhetorick in their silent Grief, that it will at last prevail against 
the Artifices of those, who either out of Guilt or Interest, are 
afraid to throw themselves upon their Country, knowing how 
scurvily they have used it; that day of Judgment will come, 
tho we know neither the day nor the hour. And our Trimmer 
would live so as to be prepared for it, with full assurance in the 
mean time, that the lamenting Voice of a Nation cannot long 
be resisted, and that a Prince who could so easily forgive his 
People when they had been in the wrong, cannot fail to hear 
them when they are in the right.
