can bear no more with them, they will cut down the Tree and 
throw it into the fire. All this while, some Superfine States- 
Men, to comfort us, would fain perswade the World that this 
or that accident may save us, and for all that is or ought to be 
dear to us, would have us to rely wholly upon Chance, not con- 
sidering that Fortune is Wisdoms Creature, and that God 
Almighty loves to be on the Wisest as well as the Strongest side; 
therefore this is such a miserable shift, such a shameful Evasion, 
that they would be laught to death for it, if the ruining Con- 
sequence of this Mistake did not more dispose Men to rage, and 
a detestation of it. 

Our Trimmer is far from Idolatry in other things, in one 
thing only he cometh near it, his Country is in some degree his 
Idol; he doth not Worship the Sun, because 'tis not peculiar to 
us, it rambles about the World, and is less kind to us than 
others; but for the Earth of England, tho perhaps inferior to 
that of many places abroad, to him there is Divinity in it, and 
he would rather dye, than see a spire of English Grass trampled 
down by a Foreign Trespasser: He thinketh there are a great 
many of his mind, for all plants are apt to taste of the Soyl in which 
they grow, and we that grow here, have a Root that produceth 
in us a Stalk of English Juice, which is not to be changed by 
grafting or foreign infusion; and I do not know whether any 
thing less will prevail, than the Modern Experiment, by which 
the Blood of one Creature is transmitted into another; accord- 
ing to which, before the French blood can be let into our 
Bodies, every drop of our own must be drawn out of them. 

Our Trimmer cannot but lament, that by a Sacrifice too great 
for one Nation to make to another, we should be like a rich 
Mine, made useless only for want of being wrought, and that 
the Life and Vigour which should move us against our Enemies 
is miserably apply'd to tear our own Bowels; that being made 
by our happy situation, not only safer, but if we please greater 
too, than other Countries which far exceed us in extent; that 
having Courage by Nature, Learning by Industry, and Riches 
by Trade, we should corrupt all these Advantages, so as to make 
them insignificant, and by a fatality which seemeth peculiar to
