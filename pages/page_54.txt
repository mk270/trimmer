they are to live upon them; and perswade the King to retrench 
his own Greatness, so as to shrink into the head of a 
Party, which is the betraying him into such an Unprincely 
mistake, and to such a wilful diminution of himself, that they 
are the last Enemies he ought to allow himself to forgive; such 
Men, if they could, would prevail with the Sun to shine only 
upon them and their Friends, and to leave all the rest of the 
World in the dark; this is a very unusual Monopoly, and may 
come within the Equity of the Law, which maketh it Treason 
to Imprison the King, when such unfitting bounds are put to his 
Favour, and he confin'd to the narrow limits of a particular set 
of Men, that would inclose him; these Honest and only Loyal 
Gentlemen, if they may be allowed to bear Witness for 
themselves, make a King their Engine, and degrade him into a 
property at the very time that their Flattery would make him 
believe they paid Divine Worship to him; besides these there is 
a flying Squadron on both sides, that are afraid the World 
should agree, small dabblers in Conjuring, that raise angry 
Apparitions to keep Men from being reconciled, like Wasps that 
fly up and down, buz and sting to keep Men unquiet; but 
these Insects are commonly short-liv'd Creatures, and no doubt 
in a little time Mankind will be rid of them; they were Gyants 
at least who fought once against Heaven, but for such Pigmies 
as these to contend against it, is such a provoking Folly, that 
the insolent Bunglers ought to be laught and hist out of the 
World for it; they should consider there is a Soul in that great 
body of the People, which may for a time be drowzy and 
unactive, but when the Leviathan is rouz'd, it moveth like an 
angry Creature, and will neither be convinced nor resisted: the 
People can never agree to shew their united Powers, till they 
are extremely tempted and provoked to it, so that to apply 
Cupping-Glasses to a great Beast naturally dispos'd to sleep, 
and to force the Tame thing whether it will or no to be Valiant, 
must be learnt out of some other Book than Machiavil, who 
would never have prescrib'd such a preposterous Method. It is 
to be remembred, that if Princes have Law and Authority on 
their sides, the People on theirs may have Nature, which is a
