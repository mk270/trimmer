to parcel out so liberally his Power amongst his Favourites, it is 
worse to divide with any other Man, and to bring himself in 
Competition with a single Rival; a Partner in Government is 
so unnatural a thing, that it is a squint-ey'd Allegiance that 
must be paid to such a double bottom'd Monarchy. The two 
Czars of Muscovy are an Example that the more civiliz'd part 
of the World will not be prone to follow. Whatsoever Gloss 
may be put upon this method, by those to whom it may be of 
some use, the Prince will do well to remember, and reflect upon 
the Story of certain Men who had set up a Statue in Honour of 
the Sun, yet in a very little time they turned their backs to the 
Sun, and their Faces to the Statue.

These Mystical Unions are better plac'd in the other World, 
than they are in this, and we shall have much ado to find, that 
in a Monarchy Gods Vicegerency is delegated to more Heads 
than that which is anointed.

Princes may lend some of their Light to make another shine, 
but they must still preserve the superiority of being the brighter 
Planet, and when it happeneth that the Reversion is in Mens 
Eyes, there is more care necessary to keep up the Dignity of

their hopes or fears who shall be. If the Sun shou'd part with all 
his Light to any of the Stars, the Indians would not know where 
to find their God, after he had so deposed himself, and would 
make the Light (where-ever it went) the Object of their Worship. 

All Usurpation is alike upon Soveraignty, it is no matter from 
what hand it cometh, and Crowned Heads are to be the more 
Circumspect, in respect Mens thoughts are naturally apt to 
ramble beyond what is present; they love to work at a distance, 
and in their greedy Expectations which their minds may be 
fill'd with of a new Master, the old one may be left to look 
a little out of Countenance.

Our Trimmer owneth a Passion for liberty, yet so restrained, 
that it doth not in the least impair or taint his Allegiance; he 
thinketh it hard for a Soul that doth not love Liberty ever to 
raise it self to another World; he taketh it to be the foundation 
of all vertue, and the only seasoning that giveth a relish to life,
