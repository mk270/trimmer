Stick another way; a dangerous Method, and a worse Extream 
for Men of that Character, who by going to the outmost line 
of Christian Liberty, will certainly encourage others to go 
beyond it; No Man doth less approve the ill-bred Methods 
of some of the Dissenters, in rebuking Authority, who behave 
themselves as if they thought ill manners necessary to Salvation; 
yet he cannot but distinguish and desire a Mean between the 
sawcyness of some of the Scotch Apostles, and the undecent 
Courtship of some of the Silken Divines, who, one would think, 
do practice to bow at the Altar, only to learn to make the better 
Legs at Court. 

Our Trimmer approveth the Principles of our Church, that 
Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that our Obedience is 
to be given to a Popish King in other things, at the same time

which ought to be our Pattern; he hath no such unreasonable 
tenderness for any sorts of Men, as to expect their faults should 
not be impartially laid open as often as they give occasion for 
it; and yet he cannot but smile to see that the same Man, who 
setteth up all the Sails of his Rhetorick, to fall upon the Dis- 
senters, when Popery is to be handled, he doth it so gingerly, 
that he looketh like an Ass mumbling of Thistles, so afraid he 
is of letting himself loose where he may be in danger of letting 
his Duty get the better of his Discretion. 

Our Trimmer is far from relishing the impertinent wandrings 
of those who pour out long Prayers upon the Congregation, 
and all from their own Stock, which God knoweth, for the most 
part is a barren Soil, which produceth weeds instead of Flowers, 
and by this means they expose Religion it self, rather than
