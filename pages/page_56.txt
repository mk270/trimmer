o_ a Trimmer.            To3

F_lshood with all her lmpudence hath not enough to gpeak ill
of  hel'  befol'e  her  Face,  such MaJesty she ca_'rieth about
her, that her most pTospe_'ous E__e Inies are fain to _hisper their
Treason; all the Power u_on Earth can ne_er e_tinguish her;
she hath liv'd in all Ages;  and let the Mistahen _eal of
__'evailing Authority christen a__y opposition to it with what
Nan_e  they  ple4se, she  maheth it not only a_  ugly  and
unmannerly, but _ dangerous thing to persist ; she hath lived
ve_ retired indeed, nay sometime so b__'ied, that only some few
of the disce_'ning part of Manhind could ha_e a Glimpse of her;
_ith all that she h_th _ternity in hel', she hno_eth not ho_ to
die, and from the d4r_est Clo__ds that shade and cove_' her, she
breaheth from time to time _ith Triu_nph for her Friends, and _
TeTTour to her Enemies.
Our  Tr2mmer therefore inspi_'ed  by this  Divine  Virt_e,
thin_eth  6t to  concl_de _ith  these Asse_'tions,  That our
Cli_ate is a Trżmmer, between that part of the Wol'ld _here
men are _oasted, and the other _here they are Frozen; That

In such Compan_, our T_'żmmer is not _sham'd of his Name,

Nature, Religion, Liberty, Prudence, H_manity and Con1mon
