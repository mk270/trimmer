Falshood with all her Impudence hath not enough to speak ill 
of her before her Face, such Majesty she carrieth about 
her, that her most prosperous Enemies are fain to whisper their 
Treason; all the Power upon Earth can never extinguish her; 
she hath had in all Ages; and let the Mistaken Zeal of 
prevailing Authority christen any opposition to it with what 
Name they please, she maketh it not only an ugly and 
unmannerly, but a dangerous thing to persist; she hath lived 
very retired indeed, nay sometime so buried, that only some few 
of the discerning part of Mankind could have a Glimpse of her; 
with all that she hath Eternity in her, she knoweth not how to 
die, and from the darkest Clouds that shade and cover her, she 
breaketh from time to time with Triumph for her Friends, and 
Terrour to her Enemies. 

Our Trimmer therefore inspired by this Divine Virtue, 
thinketh fit to conclude with these Assertions, That our 
Climate is a Trimmer, between that part of the World where 
men are Roasted, and the other where they are Frozen j That 
our Church is a Trimmer between the Phrenzy of Platonick 
Visions, and the Lethargick Ignorance of Popish Dreams; That 
our Laws are Trimmers, between the Excess of unbounded 
Power, and the Extravagance of Liberty not enough restrained; 
That true Virtue hath ever been thought a Trimmer, and to 
have its dwelling in the middle between the two Extreams; That 
even God Almighty himself is divided between his two great 
Attributes, his Mercy and his Justice. 

In such Company, our Trimmer is not ashamed of his Name, 
and willingly leaveth to the bold Champions of either Extream, 
the Honour of contending with no less Adversaries, than 
Nature, Religion, Liberty, Prudence, Humanity and Common 
Sense.
