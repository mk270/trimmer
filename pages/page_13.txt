Censure of being Partial, and to the suspicion of having some 
hidden designs to be carried on by these unusual methods. 

When all is said, there is a Natural Reason of State, an 
undefinable thing, grounded upon the Common Good of 
Mankind, which is immortal, and in all Changes and Revo- 
lutions, still preserveth its Original Right of saving a Nation, 
when the Letter of the Law perhaps would destroy it; and by 
whatsoever means it moveth, carrieth a Power with it, that 
admitteth of no opposition, being supported by Nature, which 
inspireth an immediate consent at some Critical times into 
every individual Member, to that which visibly tendeth to 
preservation of the whole; and this being so, a Wise Prince 
instead of Controverting the right of this Reason of State, will 
by all means endeavour it may be of his side, and then he will 
be secure. 

Our Trimmer cannot conceive that the Power of any Prince 
can be lasting, but where 'tis built upon the foundation of his 
own unborrowed vertue, he must not only be the first Mover 
and the Fountain, from whence the great Acts of State 
originally flow, but he must be thought so to his People that 
they may preserve their veneration for him; he must be jealous 
of his Power, and not impart so much of it to any about him, 
as that he may suffer an Eclipse by it. 

He cannot take too much care to keep himself up, for when 
a Prince is thought to be led by those, with whom he should 
onely advise, and that the Commands he giveth are transmitted 
through him, and are not of his own growth; the World will 
look upon him as a Bird adorned with Feathers that are not his 
own, or consider him rather as an Engine than a living 
Creature; besides, 'twould be a Contradiction for a Prince to 
fear a Common-wealth, and at the same time create one himself, 
by delegating such a Power to any Number of Men near him, 
as is inconsistent with the Figure of a Monarch: it is the worst 
kind of Co-ordination the Crown can submit to; for it is the 
exercise of Power that draweth the respect along with it, and 
when that is parted with, the bare Character of a King is not 
sufficient to keep it up; but tho' it is a diminution to a Prince,
