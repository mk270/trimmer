to Men dispos'd to suspect, that they were ready to interpret 
it a leaning towards Popery, without which handle it was 
Morally impossible, that the ill-affected part of the Nation 
could ever have seduc'd the rest into a Rebellion. 

That which help'd to confirm many well meaning Men in 
their Misapprehensions of the King, was the long and unusual

without one, made up a new Argument to increase their 
Suspicion, and made them presume that the Papists had a

Amongst the miserable Effects of that unnatural War, none 
hath been more fatal to us, than the forcing our Princes to

fore first set upon the Duke of Glocester, who depended so 
much upon her good will, that she might for that reason have 
been induc'd to believe, the Conquest would not be difficult; 
but it so fell out, that he either from his own Constancy, or
