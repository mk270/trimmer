The Authority of a King who is Head of the Law as well as
the Dignity  of Publick Justice, is debased, when the clear stream
of the Law is puddled and disturbed by Bunglers, or convey'd
by unclean Instruments to the People.

would tremble to see Bunglers preferred, yet the necessity of
taking Physick from a Doctor, is generally not so great as that
